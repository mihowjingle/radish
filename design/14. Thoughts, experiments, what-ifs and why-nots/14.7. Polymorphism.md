### Polymorphism after all?

(Besides generics, anyway...)

99% no, but maybe, if it didn't bring problems with it... like covariance and contravariance of generics with inheritance...

I've heard of "traits" (Groovy/Scala I think)?\
Investigate...

Or a... let's say `&` operator. Where `|` is for union types, and is like "or" (although it's more like "xor"),
the `&` would be like an "and".\
Intersection, common parts only, etc...

So as long as we only cared about some specific property, we wouldn't have to check for the type, like with a union type,
if the property was present on all the types.

Does that even still count as polymorphism?

Also, technically, (it seems that) I could make union types "smart" like that... I don't know...
