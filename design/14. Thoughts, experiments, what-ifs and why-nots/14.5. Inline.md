### Inline functions? Values? Types (fixed size, would be stored on the stack)?!

```
pi = inline 3.14159265359

myFunction = inline () {
    write("There is no myFunction! It gets 'pasted' into wherever it's called.")
}

inline type Point {
    x: Integer
    y: Integer
}

root = () {
    p = Point {
        x = 1
        y = 2
    }
    ; ... and then you check the debugger and there's just x and y (maybe "mangled" somehow, to tell them from some other x and y)
}
```

I mean...
- regarding values, the compiler should be able to do it automatically, without any prompts or suggestions... maybe?
- regarding functions, maybe it makes sense when not overused, although again - we have blocks, just run a block
- regarding types, I'm not so sure... seems unintuitive... and kind of useless, especially in conjunction with value inlining

Why does Kotlin have `inline`, exactly? **TODO**

Meh... Probably not, after all...
