### Type system

```
the most basic and flexible kind: basically interfaces and classes at the same time, freely ("ad-hoc") instantiable (except implementations)
 |          types, but disallow functions, cannot extend or contain (regular) types, but they get some cool features for free (1)
 |           |              data types, but "flattened" and continuous, basically Project Valhalla, I think - should be more performant, in general
 |           |               |
 v           v               v
type        data type       value type      <- immutable!


slot                                        <- "simple local object template",
                                               a type, but mutable and can not be passed to a function,
                                               only local, or returned from a function,
                                               which is why it may end up being called "mutable type", not "slot"
                                               can be upcast to a type (under certain conditions (see 7.4.))


unit                                        <- a "singleton", immutable, of course!
```

_(1)_ Such as:
- deep equality,
- covariance in generics,
- being valid map keys, and generally, wherever hashing applies,
- and some facilitation of (almost) automatic serialization (a "constructor" and `getProperties` with a tiny, tiny bit of "reflection" (not really), 
using code generation in compile time)

And union types, and also generic types (and functions):

```
type Maybe[T] = T | None

unit North
unit East
unit South
unit West

type Direction = North | East | South | West

anyMatch = [E] (list: List[E], predicate: E -> Boolean) -> Boolean { ... }

type Couple[A, B] {
    first: A
    second: B
}
```

And lastly, `Never`, the type with no instances/values:
- you can never (pun intended) have an instance: `myConst: Never = ...` is illegal
- an uncallable function: `Never -> any`, illegal
- a function which never (properly) returns: `any -> Never`
