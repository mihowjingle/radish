### SLOTs, or Simple Local Object Templates

So... classes? Pretty much, but... simple, I guess? And the objects are local (recommended),
returning them from functions is not recommended, but sometimes you have to. Can't pass them to functions, though.

Since they're mutable, it would be possible to make cyclical references - so that's illegal.
A `slot MySlot`, can't have `MySlot`s inside, but it can have other `slot`s, as long as it doesn't lead to a potential cycle.

Keywords: `slot`, `constructors`, `interface`, `mutation`.

```
slot Person {
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
    ageYears: Integer
    
    constructors {
        create = (firstName: String, lastName: String) -> Person {
            return Person {
                firstName = firstName
                lastName = lastName
                ageYears = 0
            }
        }
        
        createWithAge = (firstName: String, lastName: String, ageYears: Integer) -> Person {
            return Person {
                firstName = firstName
                lastName = lastName
                ageYears = ageYears
            }
        }
    }
    
    interface {
        fullName: None -> String = { firstName ++ " " ++ lastName }
        
        isAdult = () -> Boolean {
            return ageYears >= 18
        }
    
        setFirstName = mutation (firstName: String) -> None {
            firstName = firstName
        }
        
        setName = mutation (firstName: String, lastName: String) -> None {
            firstName = firstName
            lastName = lastName
        }
        
        incrementAge: None -> None = mutation {
            ageYears += 1
        }
    }
}
```

Now, `firstName: String`, `lastName: String`, `ageYears: Integer` are all private mutable state.

- In `constructors` you put functions which take any number of arguments and return the slot itself,
  and those are the only functions which are allowed to instantiate the slot object directly like that.\
  You need at least one constructor, but you can have as many as you want.
- In `interface` you put... well, the interface, functions which may or may not take arguments, may or may not mutate the object
  and then may or may not return something.
- Any method that may mutate an object of a given `slot` must be annotated with the `mutation` keyword, otherwise it won't compile.
  See 7.4.

Anyway:

```
root = (args) {
    person = Person.create("John", "Smith")
    write(person.fullName()) ; John Smith
    person.setFirstName("Patrick")
    write(person.fullName()) ; Patrick Smith
}
```

Anyway, `slot`s can contain `type`s, but not vice versa, because `type`s **are immutable**... And so on... Whatever restrictions we need
to prevent mutability from leaking out and for the automatic memory management to work.

Like: `slot` objects can't be captured in closures.
