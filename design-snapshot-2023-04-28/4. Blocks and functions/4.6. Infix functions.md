Just some syntactic sugar...

What about an `infix` function with only one parameter? Infix between what?
Nothing, `infix` functions have to have 2 or more arguments.

Anyway:

```
add: Number, Number -> Number = infix (x, y) {
    return x + y
}
```

Both are OK:

```
add(1, 2)
1.add(2)
```

And maybe even `1 add 2`, but we'll see about that.
