### But

Like "a copy of this value, but with those and those properties changed".

```
type Person {
    name: String
    age: Integer
}

person = (name: String, age: Integer) {
    return Person {
        name = name
        age = age
    }
}

peter = person("Peter", 23)

petersTwinSister = peter but {
    name = "Anna"
}
```

The last statement is equivalent to `petersTwinSister = person("Anna", 23)`.

This isn't actually mutability, but a little syntactic sugar to make it easier to live without it.\
We're still making a new person here. And the old one stays unchanged.
