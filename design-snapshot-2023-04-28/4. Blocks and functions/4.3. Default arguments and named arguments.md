### Named and default (optional) arguments

Nothing you've not seen already: default arguments...

```
greet(name: String = "stranger") -> None {
    write("Hello, {name}!")
}

greet("Tom")    ; Hello, Tom!
greet()         ; Hello, stranger!
```

... and named arguments:

```
divide = (dividend: Integer, divisor: Integer) {
    return dividend / divisor
}

write(divide(6, 3))                         ; 2
write(divide(dividend = 6, divisor = 3))    ; 2
write(divide(divisor = 6, dividend = 3))    ; 0.5
```

If you come from Python, you'll be happy to know that...

```
silly = (list: MutableList[Integer] = emptyMutableList[Integer]()) {
    list.append(1)
    write(list)
}

silly()
silly()
silly()
```

... first of all, will not even compile: functions can't accept mutable types. But if it did, it would not accumulate like:

```
[1]
[1, 1]
[1, 1, 1]
```

It would just be:

```
[1]
[1]
[1]
```

But again, doesn't even compile _(1)_. Just an example to show the idea that default arguments are "late-bound" _(2)_.

(1) safety (as in no "mutability leaks"), so actually, I guess this is predictability too\
(2) predictability
