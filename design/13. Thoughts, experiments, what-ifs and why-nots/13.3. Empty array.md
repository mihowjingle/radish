What about a function returning an empty array of some type?

We want something like `emptyArray<Element>()`. With at least one element, it's obvious, just infer the type from the element
(by the way, we need "varargs"):

```
a = array(1, 2, 3) ; Array<Integer>
```

The problem:

```
emptyArray = () { [] as ...what? }
```

With direct initiation, it's easy enough, we even have two options:

```
emptyArray: Array<Element> = []
```
```
emptyArray = [] as Array<Element>
```

So... How do we tell the function what type it should be? Maybe we just... don't?

```
emptyArray = () -> Array<some> {
    return []
}
```

And then:

```
a: Array<Element> = emptyArray()
```
```
a = emptyArray() as Array<Element>
```
