### The hierarchy (not really)

Multiple hierarchies, if anything, mostly optional. No single root, like `Object` in Java.

Initially, there was supposed to be no inheritance at all.\
Now, there's almost certainly going to be _some_ kind of inheritance, but I'm not sure yet.\
Definitely not inheritance in the sense of "avoiding duplication" of implementation, probably no implementation inheritance at all,
only in the sense of conceptual compatibility, substitution, etc. (LSP).\
See 2.3, 13.14, and 13.19.

### Custom types

##### Point

```
type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
}

isAbove = (this: Point, other: Point) { this.y > other.y }
```

Or:

```
type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
    isAbove = (other: Point) { y > other.y }
}
```

Or even:

```
type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
    
    namespace {
        isAbove = (this: Point, other: Point) { this.y > other.y }
        origin = Point {
            x = 0.0
            y = 0.0
        }
    }
}
```

And then "ad-hoc" composition...

```
point = Point {
    x = 1.0
    y = 2.4
}

anotherPoint = Point {
    x = 3.3
    y = -5.4
}

point.isAbove(anotherPoint) ; equivalent to Point.isAbove(point, anotherPoint), if for some reason you prefer this form
```

... and instead of all the constructors, factories, builders and stuff, use a function, if needed:

```
makePoint = (x: Number, y: Number) -> Point {
    return Point { x = x, y = y }
}

point = makePoint(5.0, 6.0) ; java: final Point point = new Point(5.0, 6.0);
origin = makePoint(0.0, 0.0)
```

##### Person

```
type Person {
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
    fullName = firstName + " " + lastName ; "emergent" property, probably lazy (computed only upon first access), because why not
    greet: Person -> None
}

friendlyPerson = Person {
    firstName = "John"
    lastName = "Smith"
    greet = (otherPerson) {
        write("Hello, {otherPerson.fullName}")
    }
}

makeAngryPerson: String, String -> Person = (firstName, lastName) {
    return Person {
        firstName = firstName
        lastName = lastName
        greet = {
            write("Go away, {arg.fullName}!")
        }
    }
}

angryPerson = makeAngryPerson("John", "Smith")
```

##### Final

If you want to prevent a type from being inherited from, use `final`.

```
final type Shape {
    area: Number
    perimeter: Number
}

type Square of Shape ... compilation error (of course in this case, you should remove 'final', but, well... just an example)
```

It's likely I'll reverse it: final by default and `extendable` keyword, or something.
