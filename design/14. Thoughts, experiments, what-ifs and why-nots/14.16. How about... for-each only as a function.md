Let's get crazy...

No `for i in [1, 2, 3] { ... }`. Ha! What then? `[1, 2, 3].iterate(() { ... })`. Why `iterate` and not `forEach`, like a normal person?
I don't know, maybe still `forEach`, but maybe because...

```
value Continue

type Yield[T] { ; like "break" but with a value
    val: T ; not value, because it's a keyword
}

type Result[T] = Continue | Yield[T]

iterate = infix [T] (iterable: _ promises Iteration[T], action: T -> Result[T]) -> T | None {
    while iterable.hasNext() {
        val = iterable.next()
        result = action(val)
        if result is Yield[_] {
            return result.val
        }
        ; result is Continue
    }
    return None
}
```

Then...

```
yield = [T] (t: T) {
    return Yield {
        val = t
    }
}

willBeTen = [1, 6, 8, 5, 9].iterate((number) {
    write(number)
    if number == 5 {
        return yield(10)
    }
    if number == 6 {
        return Continue
    }
    write(number)
})

; and also will print:
1
1
6
8
8
5
```

Something like that...\
Anyway, then, it's like a normal `for x in y` and if you want to only "consume", just don't return anything from the closure, or...
`return Continue` explicitly?

Yeah... clumsy and ugly, if even technically correct...

Like I said, just a crazy experiment, `for x in y` is just too convenient and familiar for every programmer ever...
I think... maybe... probably...
