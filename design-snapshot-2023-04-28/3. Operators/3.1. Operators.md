### Operators

"Semantic", as in full words, to "look like natural English":

- `&&` from some other languages becomes `and`,
- `||` becomes `or`,
- `xor`,
- `!` becomes `not`, *especially* this one, I'm allergic to `!`, easy to miss, or confuse with `i`, `I`, `l`, `|`, even `;` etc...
- `for (x : list) {}` becomes `for x in list {}`
- ... and so on

But not always: still `5 + 6`, not `5 plus 6`, etc...

All other operators:
- Comparisons: `> >= <= < == =/=`, last one being "not-equal", since I'm already not using exclamation mark for logical negation\
  Bonus: easy enough to type, no need for shift key
- By the way, in Kotlin `===` and `!==` is identity, and in Radish: `@=` and `@/=`
- `+ - / * **` arithmetics, even `//` like in Python, since we already have `**`
- `is` (instance of type)
- `%` modulo... **actually, just check 12.1. for all operators**
