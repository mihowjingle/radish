### Files

If there is one thing I would like to shamelessly steal from Python, pretty much 1:1, it's the way modules and importing work.

```
from <file> import <identifier>
from <file> import <identifier> as <alias>
import <file> ; like a little ad-hoc namespace, anyway - like Python
```

The only difference would be that we always have to start from some common root, the `src` directory, let's say.\
No relative paths to files.

### Access control

Just `internal` keyword, or `private`, or something. Maybe...\
Anyway, whatever is `internal`, cannot be imported. The end.

We're not guarding some mutable state from becoming invalid in case of free access, so we don't need anything else.\
In fact, we don't even this much.

No "default" visibility between files in the same directory. In other words, no package-private from Java.
