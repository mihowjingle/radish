At the end of 12.1. Concurrency I wrote:\
How do we make sure that a SLOT object doesn't get caught in a closure passed to `async()`?\
Boom! Mutability leaks through to another thread!

But... doesn't that affect _all_ closures? Async or not?

It "looks" local, because we define the function which we pass to some other (higher order) function, together with its closure,
but technically speaking, it's not local, it's passed "somewhere" to be then used.

So...\
Disallow mutable objects (instances of SLOTs) from closures? Probably.

**TODO**
