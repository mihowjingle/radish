Not really planning operator overloading (not saying no either), but how about some built-in ones?

Like to make making maps look slightly... cooler, I guess?\
Kotlin already has an infix `to` function... So... probably `=>`...

Another example is probably `..` for ranges. Or even `?:` and `?.` for handling `None`s, but especially that last one, probably not.
It's just not so well readable in non-trivial cases. And for `?:`, we'll have a built-in `otherwise` function.

This is all completely redundant and doesn't _read like natural English_... Probably a **nope**, just saving for future reference...
