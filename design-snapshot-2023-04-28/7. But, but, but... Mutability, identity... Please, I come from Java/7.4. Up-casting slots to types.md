If we can (and I believe we can) distinguish functions which (may) mutate
the given instance of a `slot` in which they're defined from the functions that don't,
then we can have the compiler check that for us and:
- a function may be marked with `mutation`, _then_ we may mutate the object,
- if a function is _not_ marked with `mutation`, then we can _not_:
  - reassign anything in the `slot`'s private mutable state
  - use functions marked with `mutation` in `this`, or any of the `slot`s in the `slot`'s private mutable state
- _that_ gives us the comfort that any function _not_ marked with `mutation` doesn't mutate the object, and can implement a `type`'s function
- and then, if (the immutable part of) a `slot`'s interface happens to be a superset of a `type`, then... boom!\
  Safe up-casting to a `type` in which a `slot` "loses" its mutability (we still have to say `slot ThisSlot of SomeType`, it's a nominal type system)!

Damn, side effects! Those that maybe wouldn't mutate the object, but still may get information from somewhere,
like a database, or even generate some random stuff... Although, that's possible in `type`s too, so... False alarm, I guess...

Anyway, SLOT instances can't be assigned to multiple constants in the same scope, otherwise this could be possible:

```
type Type {
    function: SomeType -> SomeOtherType
}

slot Something of Type {
    ; ... some private mutable state
    
    constructors {
        new = () { ... }
    }
    
    interface {
        someMutation = mutation (someType: SomeType) { ... }
        function = (someType: SomeType) -> SomeOtherType { ... } ; overrides Type.function
    }
}

root = {
    something = Something.new()
    x: Type = something
    something.someMutation(...)
    ; oh no! x just mutated!
}
```


But you can do this (copied from 4.1.):

```
condition: Boolean = ...
set: Set[Integer] = run({
   mutableSet = HashSet[Integer].new() ; or some other implementation
   mutableSet.add(1)
   if condition {
      mutableSet.add(2)
   }
   for i in integerRange(3, 6) {
      mutableSet.add(i)
   }
   return mutableSet
})
set.add(7) ; compilation error, Set is immutable
```
