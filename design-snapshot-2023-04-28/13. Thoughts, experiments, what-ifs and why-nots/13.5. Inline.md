### Inline functions? Values? Types ~~(fixed size, would be stored on the stack)~~ to reify a generic?!

```
pi = inline 3.14159265359

myFunction = inline () {
    write("There is no myFunction! It gets 'pasted' into wherever it's called.")
}

inline type Point {
    x: Integer
    y: Integer
}

root = () {
    p = Point {
        x = 1
        y = 2
    }
    ; ... and then you check the debugger and there's just x and y (maybe "mangled" somehow, to tell them from some other x and y)
    ; well... not exactly, see 13.2. especially 2023-04-19, but anyway - it MAY make sense after all, for reified generics...
}
```

I mean...
- regarding values, the compiler should be able to do it automatically, without any prompts or suggestions... maybe?
- regarding functions, maybe it makes sense when not overused, although again - we have blocks, just run a block
- regarding types, I'm not so sure... seems unintuitive... and kind of useless, especially in conjunction with value inlining

Why does Kotlin have `inline`, exactly? **TODO** see 13.3.

Meh... Probably not, after all...

**2023-04-19**: But still... "fixed size" type?

Maybe `fixed`, or `flat`, or `flattened`, or `compact`, or `value`, and so on...
Anyway, such a `value type` would only be allowed to consist of other `value type`s, and maybe `Array`s,
as long as I come up with some syntax for making a reference, or in this case - "reference",
to an `Array` force the size of the `Array`. An instance of such a type would not be a graph of references,
but a continuous block in memory? **TODO**
