### Varargs

Any function that accepts an array, simply, automatically, accepts "varargs":

```
doStuff = (array: Array[Integer]) -> None { ... }

doStuff(arrayOf(1, 2, 3))
doStuff(arrayOf(1, 2, 3, 4))

doStuff(1, 2, 3)
doStuff(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

Of course, for this to work, the array would have to be the last argument, etc.

But how does the `arrayOf(varargs)` function work _itself_, then?

Well, I guess we will require some "compiler duct tape". It just does. It's basically the array literal.

Bonus:

```
listOf()
setOf()
mapOf()
somethingOf()
```

... for all built-in iterables. Don't have to come up with literals...
