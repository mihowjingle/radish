Since the best I could get in 14.18. was - pretty much what I wanted but also - having to duplicate `type`s and identical `feature`s
(probably quite often), then 14.14. stays.

But:

**Option A:**

As described in 14.14.: `feature`s are allowed only in function signatures, on the "in" side, as a (kind of) type, or a type projection.
So, only one of...
- `function = (type: Feature) -> Type { ... }`, which is short for...
- `function = (type: _ promises Feature) -> Type { ... }`, or
- `function = (genericType: Type[Feature]) -> Type { ... }`, which is short for...
- `function = (genericType: Type[_ promises Feature]) -> Type { ... }`, or
- `function = (genericType: Feature[Type]) -> Type { ... }`, which is short for...
- `function = (genericType: _ promises Feature[Type]) -> Type { ... }` (but this is just the first/second option), or
- `function = [T promises Feature] (type: T) -> Type { ... }`, or
- `function = [T promises Feature] (type: Type[T]) -> Type { ... }`

... and maybe `::`, or something, instead of `promises`...

**Option B:**

As described in 14.14.: `feature`s are allowed anywhere, but only as `_ promises Feature`, not directly.
Still not sure if that fixes contravariance though. And even if it does, then the `_ promises Something` will be
a frequent "pattern" of boilerplate.

**Option C:**

`type`s can not have functions, so actually `data type`s are just `type`s now. That would mean there is no way
that a `type` "consumes" something. Automatically covariant, boom! Then we can ditch `feature`s and let `type`s simply "extend"
each other. ~~Probably more like `type TypeC combines TypeA, TypeB` or just `type TypeC :: TypeA, TypeB`.
Because it's not exactly inheritance, even if "topologically" it is.~~ Wait, `type Dog combines Animal`? Combines with what?
Maybe `includes`, I don't know why not just `extends`, but well... Just some ideas...

For now, it's **A**, until something proves it to be a bad idea.
