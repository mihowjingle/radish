### So... Features made a comeback, with a twist...

... but from the beginning:\
After the debacle of 14.7.*, I kept trying to somehow make things substitutable by other things... I thought about Python with its "special functions",
or whatever they are called, like `__str__`, because those are like "implicit",
or "unannounced" features in my idea of Radish's `feature`s.

Just add explicit declaring that a `type` "promises" (or "provides", and so on) a `feature`,
and you get Radish's `feature`s.

Except this time, how about disallow `feature`s anywhere but "types" of function parameters?

```
feature Feature { ... }
type Type { ... }
```

Then these are legal:

```
function: Type -> Type
function: Feature -> Type
```

And these are illegal:

```
function: Type -> Feature
function: Feature -> Feature
```

By the way, this should be fine:
- `function: some F promises Feature -> Type`
- `function: some (F promises Feature) -> Type`
- `function: <F promises Feature> F -> Type`
- `function: [F promises Feature] F -> Type` it's all the same thing, I just haven't decided on the syntax


And also no (local or not) constants, properties in types, type parameters, etc... All below illegal:

```
type MyType {
    property: Feature
}

myConst: Feature = ...

root = () {
    myConst: Feature = ...
}

myList: List<Feature> = ...
```

... and it's not about instantiation. If there was a `type` that implemented `Feature`, still, we can't do that!

Because... **A feature is not a type!** Boom! Done? Good?

**TODO**: _Now_ can we have "feature inheritance" without variance?
Or maybe other problems of inclusive polymorphism that I didn't think of?

Oh, and, I guess, `feature`s themselves could have type parameters?
I mean, we still need `Iterable<T>`, or `Iterability<T>`, or `Iteration<T>`, or whatever...

Oh, and... :D maybe `::` instead of `promises`. This goes against my idea of "reading out lout like natural English", but look at this:

```
returnSelf = (param: Feature) -> ??? { ; oh no!
    return param ; oh no!
}

consumeListOfFeature = (list: List[Feature]) -> None { ; oh no!
    ...
}

consumeFeature = (feature: Feature) -> None {
    ... ; this is actually ok
}

returnAnythingElse = (feature: Feature) -> Boolean {
    ... ; this is actually ok
}
```

Ok, then:

```
returnSelf = (param: P promises Feature) -> P {
    return param
}

consumeListOfFeature = [E promises Feature] (list: List[E]) -> None {
    ...
}
```

Or even:

```
consumeListOfFeature = (list: List[_ promises Feature]) -> None {
    ...
}
```

And herein lies my point. I expect a lot of `MyType[_ promises Feature]` boilerplate.

With `::`, we could have `MyType[_ :: Feature]` which is shorter, and also:

```
returnSelf = (param: P :: Feature) -> P {
    return param
}
```

... which is shorter, and _finally_ as a little indication, that `Feature` is a `feature`:

```
consumeFeature = (feature:: Feature) -> None {
    ...
}
```

Except... the whole point is that we don't care, in that last snippet.
And it does not read well out loud, and is not as "noob-friendly" as `promises`.

But we will see (except the very last snippet, that's a nope).

Lastly, yes, this is (similar to? or literally?) variance _(1)_, but only co-variance and only use-site
(which is already the easiest case, IMHO), and it's as intuitive as possible with `promises` or some similar word.

_(1)_ I just reinvented Kotlin's _type projections_ at least the `out` part. Now, do I need the `in` part?
Since `type`s are immutable?

~~Ok, we could make these legal:~~

```
consumeListOfFeature = (list: List[Feature]) -> None {
    ...
}

consumeFeature = (feature: Feature) -> None {
    ...
}
```

~~But **only in this specific situation** (in which we don't care about exact type of `Feature`,
because we don't intend to do anything with it, like return it) and **only as syntactic sugar for**:~~

```
consumeListOfFeature = (list: List[_ promises Feature]) -> None {
    ...
}

consumeFeature = (feature: _ promises Feature) -> None {
    ...
}
```

~~In any other case,~~ _(2)_ you would have to say `T promises Feature`. _Now_ I think it's done.
And now "feature inheritance" would rather be "feature combination",
not to have to write `T promises This, That, Feature1, Feature2, Something`.

_(2)_ There is **never** `feature: Feature`, not even in function signatures, **always** `T promises Feature`,
even if we don't care. Then, `_ promises Feature`. Now we can actually even allow other things, like constants:
`myConst: _ promises Feature = Type { ... }` (`type Type promises Feature { ... }`).
Of course, now that would allow for code to be littered with `_ promises Something` all over,
and that doesn't make sense anyway, so why? Just make it `myConst: Type = Type { ... }`, or just `myConst = Type { ... }`.
But also, why not? We'll see...

----------

Let's go back to 14.7.3.:

```
type Consumer[A] {
    consume: A -> None
}

type Animal { ... }
type Cat of Animal { ... }
type Dog of Animal { ... }

root = () {
    consumer1: Consumer[Cat] = Consumer {
        consume = (cat: Cat) { ... }
    }
    consumer2: Consumer[Animal] = consumer1
    consumer2.consume(Dog { ... }) ; ... aaaaand BOOM, CRACK, HISS!
}
```

Now let's apply the new design to that code (`type`s are **invariant**):

```
type Consumer[A] {
    consume: A -> None
}

feature Animal { ... }
type Cat promises Animal { ... }
type Dog promises Animal { ... }

root = () {
    consumer1: Consumer[Cat] = Consumer {
        consume = (cat: Cat) { ... }
    }
    consumer2: Consumer[Animal] = consumer1 ; <- invalid syntax, or at least illegal assignment:
    ; "'_ promises Animal' is not 'Cat', because it's type is unknown (a feature is not a type)" or something
    consumer2.consume(Dog { ... }) ; ... aaaaand NICE! No problem, we don't even get this far...
}
```

Now let's correct it:

```
type Consumer[A] {
    consume: A -> None
}

feature Animal { ... }
type Cat promises Animal { ... }
type Dog promises Animal { ... }

root = () {
    consumer1: Consumer[_ promises Animal] = Consumer {
        consume = (animal: _ promises Animal) { ... }
    }
    consumer2: Consumer[_ promises Animal] = consumer1 ; we don't even need this
    consumer2.consume(Dog { ... }) ; ... aaaaand NICE! We can only access whatever Animal gives us inside of 'consume'
}
```

And now, at the happy end of the journey, a question:\
Is this better than to merge `feature`s and `type`s, have (interface only) inheritance, and embrace variance (and steal Kotlin's design for it)?\
For now, let's say it is...
