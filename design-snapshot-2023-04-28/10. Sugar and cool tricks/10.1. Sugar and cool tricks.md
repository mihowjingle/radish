### String interpolation

```
x = 5
write("Five equals {x}.")
text = "Seven equals {x + 2}."
write(text)
```

Obviously we have to escape `{` with a `\{`.

### When you don't care...

`_` for ignoring things. Unused parameters, etc...

### Smart casts

Like Kotlin or TypeScript:

```
type TypeA {
    a: Integer
}

type TypeB {
    b: String
}

someFunction = () -> TypeA | TypeB {
    ...
}

result = someFunction()
write(result.a) ; compilation error
if result is TypeA {
    write(result.a) ; ok
}
```

By the way, manual casts with `as`, sure, why not, then you take responsibility:

```
result = someFunction() as TypeA
write(result.a) ; no compilation error, but may crash
```

By the way 2:

```
result = someFunction() as TypeC ; compilation error here already:
; someFunction returns TypeA | TypeB, but never TypeC
```

### Local functions and types... Why not?

```
function = () {
    localFunction = () {}    
    plus: Integer, Integer -> Integer = (x, y) { x + y }
    
    type LocalType {
        name: String
        something: Number
    }
    
    ...
}
```

### Dangling commas, etc.

```
quiteOk = [
    1,
    4,
    5,
]
```

### Better readability of numbers with _

```
fourMillion = 4000000
fiveMillion = 5_000_000
```

### Chained comparisons

You know what I could steal from Python? Chained comparisons, or whatever they are called:\
`x < y < z` being the equivalent of `x < y and y < z`, and so on...

Looks convenient and I can't see why not... It wouldn't be on the top of the priority list, but...
