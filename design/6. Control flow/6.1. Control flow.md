### If statement

```
condition: Boolean = 4 == 5

if condition {
    ; condition is satisfied
}

if x == 5 {
    ; x equals 5
}

if condition1 {
    ; condition1 is true
} else if condition2 {
    ; condition1 is not true, but condition2 is
} else {
    ; well... else
}
```

So unlike 99% languages, no parentheses around the condition. If is also an expression.

### If expression

```
y = if condition { 5 } else { 6 }
```

Or maybe:

```
y = if condition then 5 else 6
```

50/50 for now, or maybe both? Probably not though, only one.

Or Python: `y = 5 if condition else 6`, maayyybe... But this is just reordered second option.\
First option is more flexible. Second option looks better in such a simple case, which will probably be 99% of cases... **TBD**

### Alternative to if-elseif-elseif-elseif-elseif-elseif-else, and pattern matching

First: to smart-cast or not to smart-cast? **TODO** I assumed we would, but it's actually not necessary. Not even in `if`s:

```
if someObject is Type {
    ; smart-cast, someObject can access properties of Type
}
```

... or:

```
if someObject is typeObject: Type {
    ; typeObject is the same object, but now as Type
}
```

Same decision is to be made here, we will see. For now 51/49 in favor of smart-casts.
Depends, which is easier to program into the compiler, probably...

Anyway:

```
x: Integer | MyCustomType = ...

result = when x {
    is Integer then when {
        x > 0 then "Positive integer!"
        x < 0 then "Negative integer!"
        else "Zero!"
    }
    is MyCustomType then {
        ; do something with MyCustomType and get the String
    }
    ; no else, check is already exhaustive
}
```

And:

```
x: Integer | MyCustomType = ...

result = when {
    x is Integer then when {
        x > 0 then "Positive integer!"
        x < 0 then "Negative integer!"
        else "Zero"
    }
    x is MyCustomType then {
        ; do something with MyCustomType and get the String
    }
    else {
        ; ... we're not matching on an expression/value, so we don't know what else could be possible,
        ; so, else is required
    }
}
```

So yeah, nothing special. Basically Kotlin.

### Loops: while

Boringly standard...

```
while condition {
    ; we're stuck until condition becomes false
}
```

... or we `break` out:

```
while a {
    if b {
        break
    }
    if c {
        continue
    }
}
```

### Loops: for (each)

Again, you've seen this a million times:

```
for element in iterable {
    ; do stuff with element
}
```

(`break` and `continue`, early `return` applicable, like in any language)

For example:

```
anyAboveFive = (numbers: Array<Number>) {
    for number in numbers {
        if number > 5.0 {
            return True
        }
    }
    return False
}
```

What if you want a "classic" `for (int x = 4; x < 11; x++)`?\
Short answer: Python.

Slightly longer answer (but for `for (int x = 1; x <= 9; x += 2)`):

```
for x in integerRange(1, 9, step = 2) {
    ; do stuff with x
}
```

Something like that, give or take... TBD how it works under the hood, exactly.\
Both ends of the range are inclusive though (at least by default), c'mon Python, you **could** do better...
