At the end of 2.1. I say:

Kotlin's `() -> Unit` is `None -> None`, etc.

**But wait...**\
`None` is a type and its only value at the same time... so wouldn't that require us to pass it?

```
runnable: None -> None = () {
    write("Hmmm...")
}

runnable()
runnable(None)
```

Is that a problem? Or can we just pass `None` automatically, or better, pass nothing,
and this is just a "syntactical corner case", or something? ...handled by the compiler?

Anyway, **TODO**
