How about a `sideeffect` keyword, with which we have to mark a function if it uses or creates side effects, under the pain of compilation error?
Then, a function which uses that first function also has to be marked and so on...

Problem is, can we confidently say, that using a `None -> some T`, or `some T -> None` (or `some T, some U -> None` and so on),
or obviously `None -> None` means side effect, and vice versa? I... think... so? **TODO**

Actually, look at examples: `memoized`. The function `mutableMap<T, R>()` returns an empty map, there - side effect,
but `memoized` itself has no _actual_ side effects, the map is just cache.

Also, what purpose would that serve? Besides just warning...
