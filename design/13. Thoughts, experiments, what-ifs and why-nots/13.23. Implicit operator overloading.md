So I decided not to include operator overloading, but sometimes, it would be really convenient.
Like: `x == y` is much better than `x.equals(y)`, so...

How about "implicit" operator overloading? Where you don't mark functions in any special way, but when a function
just happens to accidentally have a compatible signature, then sure, why not...

Then, for equals that would have to be:

```
type MyType of Equatable[MyType] {
    
    hashCode: None -> Integer = ...
    
    equals: MyType -> Boolean = ...
}

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

object1 = MyType {
    ...
}

object2 = MyType {
    ...
}

object1.equals(object2)
object1 == object2
```

Both forms would be perfectly acceptable. Also, that gives us (actually, operator overloading in general does) `=/=` for free.

Same with `get = [E] (index: Integer) -> E` on some type, then you can use `myTypeInstance[index]`,
or `plus = (other: MyType) -> MyType`, or comparable, and so on...
