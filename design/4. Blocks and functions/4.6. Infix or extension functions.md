Probably... Although it's really just syntactic sugar...

What about an "extension function" / "infix function", with only one parameter?
Maybe "extension", but certainly not "infix", because... infix between what?

Either:
- ~~not `infix`, some other keyword - probably not~~
- require `infix` functions to have 2 or more arguments - ~~probably~~ yes

Anyway:

```
add: Number, Number -> Number = infix (x, y) {
    return x + y
}
```

Both are OK:

```
add(1, 2)
1.add(2)
```
