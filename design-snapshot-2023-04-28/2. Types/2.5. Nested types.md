What if types could have "depth", a tree-like structure, rather than being a flat list of attributes?

Consider a pretty standard situation:

```
type Address {
    country: String
    city: String
    street: String
    id: String ; not a number, because sometimes it's "17B", or something, and it's just for identification
}

type Person {
    name: String
    age: Integer
    address: Address
}
```

Now imagine that we're only ever need an `Address` in the context some `Person`. Then, why not:

```
type Person {
    name: String
    age: Integer
    address: {
        country: String
        city: String
        street: String
        id: String
    }
}
```

Obviously, because then what is the type of `address`?

**Solution**:

```
type Person {
    name: String
    age: Integer
    address: type Address {
        country: String
        city: String
        street: String
        id: String
    }
}
```

If you come from Java, `Address` is basically a `static class` inside `Person` (still usable outside) as `Person.Address`.
