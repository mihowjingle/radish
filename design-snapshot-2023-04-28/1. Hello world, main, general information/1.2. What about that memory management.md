No mutability is nice even for conceptual reasons, it's easier to think about things. But also...

- (almost) no mutability, only creating new things **plus**
- (almost) no identity or references, only values **plus**
- simple concurrency with no shared state between threads (or thread pools?), only initiating a task and getting the result **plus**
- automatic reference counting **plus** cyclical references forbidden by the compiler **plus maybe**
- some clever heap allocation strategy (tuned and tweaked with the previous points in mind, if even needed) **equals**
- (almost) "compile-time garbage collection"?

**TODO**
