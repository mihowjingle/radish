Just a stupid experiment since, technically, you can recreate `for` with a `while`,
so "what if" I didn't put it in as a separate keyword...

```
for = inline (initial: some T, predicate: T -> Boolean, next: T -> T, do: T -> None) {
    with acc = initial while predicate(acc) {
        do(acc)
        acc = next(acc)
    }
}
```

And then, instead of a `for (int x = 1; x <= 9; x += 2)`:

```
for(1, { arg <= 9 }, { arg + 2 }, () {
    ; do stuff
})
```

But no, because:
- looks clunky
- can't break... (continue would be an early return from the inner function, I guess)

Actually you could make...

```
value Break
value Continue

for = inline (initial: some T, predicate: T -> Boolean, next: T -> T, do: T -> None | Break | Continue) {
    with acc = initial while predicate(acc) {
        result = do(acc)
        if result == Break {
            break
        } else if result == Continue {
            continue
        }
        acc = next(acc)
    }
}

for(1, { arg <= 9 }, { arg + 2 }, {
    ; do stuff
    if ... {
        return Break
    }
    ; do stuff
})
```

Maybe... Something like that... Can't be bothered to check. Anyway - no.
