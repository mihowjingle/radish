### While with accumulator

What if you absolutely need mutable state?\
There should be always a way to avoid it, but what if it's more convenient, or whatever?
Ladies and gentlemen, I give you `with`!

```
with x = 1 while condition {
    ; x is mutable here
}
; x is immutable here
```

### For (each) with accumulator

```
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
with acc = 0 for n in numbers {
    acc += n ; quite ok
}
acc += 1 ; not ok, compilation error
```

Not sure if we will need "short" operators (`+= -= /= *=`) often enough to justify their existence
in this _mostly stateless_ language, but we will see.
