Is there such a thing as too much flexibility? We could easily disallow some of the following and still be able to do everything (from 4.2.):

```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) -> Number {
    return a + b
}
```
```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) {
    return a + b
}
```
```
sum: Number, Number -> Number = (a, b) {
    return a + b
}
```

And remember, `return` is optional.

```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) {
    a + b
}
```
```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) { a + b }
```
```
sum: Number, Number -> Number = (a, b) { a + b }
```
