What if types could have "depth", a tree-like structure, rather than being a flat list of attributes?

Consider a pretty standard situation:

```
type Address {
    country: String
    city: String
    street: String
    id: String ; not a number, because sometimes it's "17B", or something, and it's just for identification
}

type Person {
    name: String
    age: Integer
    address: Address
}
```

Now imagine that we're only ever need an `Address` in the context some `Person`. Then, why not:

```
type Person {
    name: String
    age: Integer
    address: {
        country: String
        city: String
        street: String
        id: String
    }
}
```

Obviously, because then what is the type of `address`?

**Solution A**:

```
person: Person = ...
address = person.address ; compilation error: "address is not assignable, something, something..."
```

**Solution B**:

```
type Person {
    name: String
    age: Integer
    address: type Address {
        country: String
        city: String
        street: String
        id: String
    }
}
```

**Questions:**

What's this for? What's the advantage? And most importantly: any problems that I don't yet see?\
Is it still just `Address`, or `Person.Address`? Is `Address` usable outside a `Person` instance (`static`, if this was Java)?
