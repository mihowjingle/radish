### The hierarchy (not really)

Multiple hierarchies, if anything, mostly optional. No single root, like `Object` in Java.

Initially, there was supposed to be no inheritance at all. Mostly to simplify things (most of the time it's not needed),
and to avoid variance with generic types, which is... tricky... at least IMHO, will be a problem for beginners.
Unfortunately, inheritance is just too useful to give up. And as soon as we have inheritance
(or even other kind of polymorphism, like structural typing, for example), variance emerges.
Of course, I could just say "generics in Radish are invariant, end of story, goodbye", but again - it seems a bit restrictive.

Therefore, in this design snapshot, we have standard inheritance and standard variance, the TLDR is of which is Kotlin:
`in`, `out`, and type projections like `function = [T of Supertype] (object: T) -> String { ... }`

See 2.3.

### Custom types

##### Point

```
type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
    isAbove = (other: Point) { y > other.y }
}
```

And then "ad-hoc" composition...

```
point = Point {
    x = 1.0
    y = 2.4
}
```

... and instead of all the constructors, factories, builders and stuff, use a function, if needed:

```
makePoint = (x: Number, y: Number) -> Point {
    return Point { x = x, y = y }
}

point = makePoint(5.0, 6.0) ; java: final Point point = new Point(5.0, 6.0);
origin = makePoint(0.0, 0.0)
```

```
point = Point {
    x = 1.0
    y = 2.4
    isAbove = ... ; compilation error: isAbove is an implementation
}
```

Make your own (but then you **have to** override **every** member)...

```
type MyPoint of Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
    isAbove = (other: Point) { some other implementation }
}
```

... which solves the diamond problem, by the way. Here's a shortcut if you don't want to _actually_ override:

```
type MyPoint of Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
    isAbove from Point
}
```

Note that in this specific example, `MyPoint` is literally just `Point`, and you will get a warning (but it will compile).

##### Person

```
type Person {
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
    fullName = firstName + " " + lastName ; "emergent" property, lazy (computed only upon first access)
    greet: Person -> None
}

friendlyPerson = Person {
    firstName = "John"
    lastName = "Smith"
    greet = (otherPerson) {
        write("Hello, {otherPerson.fullName}")
    }
}

makeAngryPerson: String, String -> Person = (firstName, lastName) {
    return Person {
        firstName = firstName
        lastName = lastName
        greet = {
            write("Go away, {arg.fullName}!")
        }
    }
}

angryPerson = makeAngryPerson("John", "Smith")
```

##### Final

If you want to prevent a type from being inherited from, use `final`.

```
final type Shape {
    area: Number
    perimeter: Number
}

type Square of Shape ... compilation error (of course in this case, you should remove 'final', but, well... just an example)
```

For the sake of this "design snapshot", this is it.
But it's likely I'll reverse it: final by default and `extendable` keyword, or something.
