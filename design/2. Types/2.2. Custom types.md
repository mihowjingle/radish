### The hierarchy (not really)

Multiple hierarchies, if anything, mostly optional. No single root, like `Object` in Java.

Initially, there was supposed to be no inheritance at all.\
Now, there's almost certainly going to be _some_ kind of inheritance, but I'm not sure yet.\
Definitely not inheritance in the sense of "avoiding duplication" of implementation, probably no implementation inheritance at all,
only in the sense of conceptual compatibility, substitution, etc. (LSP).\
See 2.3, 13.14, and 13.19.

### Custom types

##### Point

```
type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
    isAbove = (other: Point) { y > other.y }
}
```

And then "ad-hoc" composition...

```
point = Point {
    x = 1.0
    y = 2.4
}
```

... and instead of all the constructors, factories, builders and stuff, use a function, if needed:

```
makePoint = (x: Number, y: Number) -> Point {
    return Point { x = x, y = y }
}

point = makePoint(5.0, 6.0) ; java: final Point point = new Point(5.0, 6.0);
origin = makePoint(0.0, 0.0)
```

##### Person

```
type Person {
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
    fullName = firstName + " " + lastName ; "emergent" property
    greet: Person -> None
}

friendlyPerson = Person {
    firstName = "John"
    lastName = "Smith"
    greet = (otherPerson) {
        write("Hello, {otherPerson.fullName}")
    }
}

makeAngryPerson: String, String -> Person = (firstName, lastName) {
    return Person {
        firstName = firstName
        lastName = lastName
        greet = {
            write("Go away, {arg.fullName}!")
        }
    }
}

angryPerson = makeAngryPerson("John", "Smith")
```
