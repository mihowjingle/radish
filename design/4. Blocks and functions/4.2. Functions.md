### Functions

Inherently anonymous, only assignable (no overloading then, but it's ok - we have default argument values and union types).\
All below are equivalent:

```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) -> Number {
    return a + b
}
```
```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) {
    return a + b
}
```
```
sum: Number, Number -> Number = (a, b) {
    return a + b
}
```

And remember, `return` is optional.

```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) {
    a + b
}
```
```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) { a + b }
```
```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) -> Number { a + b }
```
```
sum: Number, Number -> Number = (a, b) { a + b }
```

... and so on.

### Passing functions to functions

First, let's define a higher order function to receive our functions as arguments:

```
forever = (action: None -> None) -> Never {
    while (True) {
        action()
    }
}
```

And then...

```
forever(() {
    write("Spam!")
})
```
```
forever({
    write("Spam!")
})
```
```
spam = () {
    write("Spam!")
}
forever(spam)
```

### Returning functions from functions

```
makeQuadraticFunction: Number, Number, Number -> (Number -> Number) = (a, b, c) {
    return (x) { a * x ** 2 + b * x + c }
}

quadraticFunction = makeQuadraticFunction(1, 2, 4) ; f(x) = x2 + 2x + 4
nineteen = quadraticFunction(3)
```

By the way, Kotlin: `it`, Radish: `arg`.

```
square: Number -> Number = (x) {
    return x * x
}
```

```
square: Number -> Number = {
    return arg * arg
}
```

... or even:

```
square: Number -> Number = { arg * arg }
```

### Comparisons to other languages

Java...

```
public class SomeClass {

    void stuff() {}

    void moreStuff() {
        final Runnable f = this::stuff;
    }
}
```

... while Radish (by the way, local functions):

```
stuff: None -> None = () {}

moreStuff = () {
    f = stuff
}
```

... or just (type inference):

```
stuff = () {}

moreStuff = () {
    f = stuff
}
```

### Implicit argument for single-argument functions

Notice how in the second and fourth example we don't even have parentheses to indicate a function.\
In those cases, we know that it's a function because of the explicit type.\
In the fourth example, we can access the program arguments through a special name `arg`,\
which works exactly like Kotlin's `it`:

```
numbers = [-1, 0, 1, 2]
positiveNumbers = numbers.where({ arg > 0 })
```

By the way, `where` is known as `filter` in other languages, but `where` is a better name.

I may (probably) disallow some forms of writing functions. See 13.8.
