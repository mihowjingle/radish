If we can (and I believe we can) distinguish functions which (may) mutate
the given instance of a `slot` in which they're defined from the functions that don't,\
then we can have the compiler check that for us and:
- a function may be marked with `mutation`, _then_ we may mutate the object,
- if a function is _not_ marked with `mutation`, then we can _not_:
  - reassign anything in the `slot`'s private mutable state
  - use functions marked with `mutation` in `this`, or any of the `slot`s in the `slot`'s private mutable state
- _that_ gives us the comfort that any function _not_ marked with `mutation` doesn't mutate the object, and can implement a `type`'s function
- and then, if (the immutable part of) a `slot`'s interface happens to be a superset of a `type`, then... boom!\
  Safe up-casting to a `type` in which a `slot` "loses" its mutability (we still have to say `slot ThisSlot of SomeType`, it's a nominal type system)!

**TODO**: ...right?!

Damn, side effects! Those that maybe wouldn't mutate the object, but still may get information from somewhere,
like a database, or even generate some random stuff... Although, that's possible in `type`s too, so... False alarm?
