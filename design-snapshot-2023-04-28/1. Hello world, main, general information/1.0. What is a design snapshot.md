"Design snapshots", as you may already conclude from the name, are points in time, where I decide to copy the design directory,\
"collapse" all the maybes, all the TODOs, TBDs, and make _some_ decision for each of them,\
according to what I think and what "flavor" of the syntax I prefer **at the time**, etc.

Then I look at some examples etc., generally speaking - challenge the design.
