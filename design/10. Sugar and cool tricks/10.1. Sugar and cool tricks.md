### Multi-assign? Maybe...

TBD, but basically Python (except there are no tuples involved, pure syntactic sugar). **2023-04-27:** probably not...

```
x, y = 1, 2
```

### String interpolation
```
x = 5
write("Five equals {x}.")
text = "Seven equals {x + 2}."
write(text)
```

Obviously we have to escape `{` with a `\{`.

### Multiline strings

```
someString = |This
             | is
             |   a multiline
             | string!

otherString =
    | This is
    | OK
    | too.

compilationError = | This will not
                     | compile!
```

The pipes `|` have to be on the same column, otherwise it doesn't compile!
The string starts with a pipe, and ends, when there is a non-pipe character
at the beginning of some next consecutive line, excluding whitespace.

### Operator overloading?
```
TODO, 50/50
```

### Destructuring? Useful enough?

49% yes, 51% no on this... **2023-04-27:** ok, _maybe_ for pattern matching at least...

```
type Point {
    x: Integer
    y: Integer
}

p = Point {
    x = 1
    y = 7
}

a, b = p

; a == 1, b == 7
```

And how about...

```
type Person {
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
    age: Integer
}

person = Person {
    firstName = "Anna"
    lastName = "Smith"
    age = 33
}

name, _, age = person
```

`_` for when we don't care?

### Speaking of not caring...

`_` or... what? Maybe `?` for ignoring things? Unused parameters and type parameters, etc...

### Smart casts

Like Kotlin or TypeScript:

```
type TypeA {
    a: Integer
}

type TypeB {
    b: String
}

someFunction = () -> TypeA | TypeB {
    ...
}

result = someFunction()
write(result.a) ; compilation error
if result is TypeA {
    write(result.a) ; ok
}
```

By the way, manual casts with `as`, sure, why not, then you take responsibility:

```
result = someFunction() as TypeA
write(result.a) ; no compilation error, but may crash
```

By the way 2:

```
result = someFunction() as TypeC ; compilation error here already:
; someFunction returns TypeA | TypeB, but never TypeC
```

### Local functions and types? Maybe... Probably... Why not?

```
function = () {
    localFunction = () {}    
    plus: Integer, Integer -> Integer = (x, y) { x + y }
    
    type LocalType {
        name: String
        something: Number
    }
    
    ...
}
```

### Dangling commas, etc.

```
quiteOk = [
    1,
    4,
    5,
]
```

99% yes.

### Better readability of numbers with _

```
fourMillion = 4000000
fiveMillion = 5_000_000
```

### Chained comparisons

You know what I could steal from Python? Chained comparisons, or whatever they are called:\
`x < y < z` being the equivalent of `x < y and y < z`, and so on...

Looks convenient and I can't see why not... It wouldn't be on the top of the priority list, but...
