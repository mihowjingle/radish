Probably... Although it's really just syntactic sugar... 50/50?

**TODO:** Ey! What about an "extension function" / "infix function", with only one parameter?
Maybe "extension", but certainly not "infix", because... infix between what?

Either:
- not `infix`, some other keyword
- require `infix` functions to have 2 or more arguments
