Like in a few other cases, this is a question of "sane defaults" to avoid "silent failures" (... eh, how to say it?).\
The problem is that maybe we can't rely on automatic decision by the compiler (**not**) to optimize a recursive function to a loop,\
because a programmer may think that should happen, when it actually can't.

In that case, the programmer will walk away wrongly satisfied that they just wrote some clever code.
So, let's have a `tail` keyword to mark functions with. Then, if the programmer wants to be sure that a function will
indeed be optimized, they can mark it with `tail`. Then, either:
- it will be optimized, because it can
- compilation error occurs, because a function marked with `tail` can _not_ actually be tail-recursive

Also, I guess the compiler may still decide to tail-optimize if it's possible, even without `tail`?
