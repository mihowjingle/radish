### Console

```
write: String -> None
read: None -> String
```

### Data structures

Tuples, arrays, sets, lists, stacks, queues, maps (dictionaries?)...

Divided into mutable/immutable counterparts with ~~`freeze()`~~ `frozen()` for returning a `Set<T>` from a `MutableSet<T>`
(and ~~`melt()`~~ `molten()` for opposite? hehehehe) etc.\
Also, all the map, ~~filter~~ where, find, reduce, fold, counting, associating/grouping, any, all, single...\
See 14. Samples. Actually, just see Kotlin.

```
type Couple some A, B {
    first: A
    second: B
}

type Triple some A, B, C {
    first: A
    second: B
    third: C
}

; and so on
```

### Math

```
Fraction ; numerator, denominator, maybe with unsigned integers and a third property: sign, or signed numerator, unsigned denominator
PreciseDecimal ; basically BigDecimal from Java
Complex ; you know, the stuff with square root of -1

square root, or root of any degree, absolute value etc., etc.
average, min, max, and other statistical stuff, etc.
is a number: even, odd... and...?? anyway, checking different propeties of numbers...
```

### Time

```
Date
DateTime
Time
ZonedDateTime ; ... and so on
```

### If you really, really insist on local variables...

```
slot Variable[T] {
    value: T
    
    constructors {
        new = (value: T) {
            value = value
        }
    }
    
    interface {
        set = mutation (newValue) { value = newValue }
        get = () { value }
    }
}

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

root = (args) {
    number = Variable.new(5)
    write(number.get())
    number.set(7)
    write(number.get())
    
    ; with type:
    otherNumber: Variable[Integer] = Variable.new(1)
    otherNumber.set(otherNumber.get() + 1)
    write(otherNumber.get())
}

; will print 5 then 7 then 2 (stinky, smelly code, but like I said: "if you insist", it's just an example anyway)
```

### Concurrency

See 11. Concurrency.\
Probably concurrency will be done as functions and types in the stdlib, rather than dedicated keywords...\
Unless not...

### Other...
- **testing**: official testing and mocking framework
- **random**: random numbers, random strings, random element of collection...
- **logging**: with all the levels (debug, info...), formatting, rolling, redirecting...
- **http**: official HTTP (and REST api) client, etc...
- **networking**: low-level stuff, sockets...
- **sql**: for selecting stuff (and maybe a library for no-sql too by the way?)
- **graphics**: images, video, colors...
- **sound**: since I'm doing graphics, then why not...
- **gui**: well, you can't just use the terminal forever
- **zip**: zip and maybe other compression stuff...
- **emails**: sending, receiving...
- **parsing**: json, xml, yml, csv... all that...
- **files**: files in general, text, binary, reading, writing...
- **security**: all the hashing and cyphering...
- **util** or **misc**: other miscellaneous stuff like for example `Variable` (see above),
  `otherwise` function (equivalent of Kotlin's `?:` operator), and many more...
- ... and so many others that I forgot. Anyway, I like "official" libraries so that the community doesn't have to
  maintain 15 different implementations of the same thing, competing with each other, so I want the standard library
  to be "rich" and cover a lot of topics.
