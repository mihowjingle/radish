### Code blocks

1. Good to conceptually distinguish one "layer" (or perhaps a step rather than a layer) of logic from another, but do it "ad-hoc",
   like it's an immediately-called, zero-argument anonymous function, or something.
2. Good for "compile-time garbage collection". After we exit a block, we know we can deallocate all memory allocated in it
   (and not "attached" to some other reference).
   We don't have to wait until we exit the outer scope.
3. Enable us to safely treat mutable objects as immutable ones. See 14.20.

```
r = 1
area = {
    pi = 3.14
    pi * r ** 2
} ; pi memory can be released now
```

There may be `yield`, like a `return` for blocks, see 14.8.
