### The hierarchy (not really)

No inheritance. No classes, "templates", or some such (except, there are (8.2. SLOTs), but only if you insist and still, no inheritance).\
Just functions and ~~objects~~ values of some types.

So only "interfaces" and "final, immutable, anonymous implementations" thereof as per Java's point of view (again, except SLOTs).\
And functions to compose them however you wish.

### Custom types

##### Point

```
type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
    isAbove = (other: Point) { y > other.y }
}
```

And then "ad-hoc" composition...

```
point = Point {
    x = 1.0
    y = 2.4
}
```

... and instead of all the constructors, factories, builders and stuff, use a function, if needed:

```
makePoint = (x: Number, y: Number) -> Point {
    return Point { x = x, y = y }
}

point = makePoint(5.0, 6.0) ; java: final Point point = new Point(5.0, 6.0);
origin = makePoint(0.0, 0.0)
```

##### Person

```
type Person {
    firstName: String
    lastName: String
    fullName = firstName + " " + lastName ; "emergent" property
    greet: Person -> None
}

friendlyPerson = Person {
    firstName = "John"
    lastName = "Smith"
    greet = (otherPerson) {
        write("Hello, {otherPerson.fullName}")
    }
}

makeAngryPerson: String, String -> Person = (firstName, lastName) {
    Person {
        firstName = firstName
        lastName = lastName
        greet = {
            write("Go away, {arg.fullName}!")
        }
    }
}

angryPerson = makeAngryPerson("John", "Smith")
```
