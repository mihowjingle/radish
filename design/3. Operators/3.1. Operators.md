### Operators

"Semantic", as in full words:

- `&&` from some other languages becomes `and`,
- `||` becomes `or`,
- `xor`,
- `!` becomes `not`, *especially* this one, I'm allergic to `!`, easy to miss, or confuse with `i`, `I`, `l`, `|`, even `;` etc...
- `for (x : list) {}` becomes `for x in list {}`
- ... and so on

But not always: still `5 + 6`, not `5 plus 6`, etc...

All other operators:
- Comparisons: `> >= <= < == =/=`, last one being "not-equal", since I'm already not using exclamation mark for logical negation\
  Bonus: easy enough to type, no need for shift key
- By the way, in Kotlin `===` is identity, and if I do identity in Radish: `@=`
- `+ - / * **` arithmetics, probably even `//` like in Python, since we already have `**`, just have to use something else for comments,\
  and since we have `**` then, ~~maybe something for root?~~ (nope, I mean yes, but not as an operator)
- Something for Kotlin's `?:`? ~~Overloaded `else`? Overloaded `or`? Probably~~ `otherwise`~~, probably~~ (again, as a function) ~~though...~~
- `is` (instance of type)
- `%` modulo... **actually, just check 13.1. for all operators**
- Bitwise operators? Kind of low-level, probably not...

Kotlin:

```
val notNullString = nullableString ?: "default"
```

Radish:

```
notNullString = nullableString.otherwise("default")
```
