### Code blocks

1. Good to conceptually distinguish one "layer" (or perhaps a step rather than a layer) of logic from another, but do it "ad-hoc",
   like it's an immediately-called, zero-argument anonymous function, or something.
2. Good for "compile-time garbage collection". After we exit a block, we know we can deallocate all memory allocated in it.
   We don't have to wait until we exit the outer scope.

```
r = 1
area = {
    pi = 3.14
    pi * r ** 2
} ; pi memory can be released now
```
