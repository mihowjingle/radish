What about a function returning an empty array of some type?

We want something like Kotlin's `emptyArray<Element>()`. With at least one element, it's obvious, just infer the type from the element
(by the way, we need "varargs"):

```
array: Array<Integer> = [1, 2, 3]
```

The problem:

```
emptyArray = () { [] as ...what? }
```

With direct initiation, it's easy enough, we even have two options:

```
emptyArray: Array<Element> = []
```
```
emptyArray = [] as Array<Element>
```

And... That's it... When would you ever need a constant of an empty array anyway?

```
printAll = (array: Array[any A of Printable]) {
    for element in array {
        print(element)
    }
}

printAll([])
```

Perfectly fine. Same as...

```
map = (array: Array[any A], function: A -> any B) -> Array[B] {
    if array.isEmpty {
        return []
    }
    accumulator = List[B].new()
    for element in array {
        accumulator.append(function(element))
    }
    return accumulator.toArray()
}
```
