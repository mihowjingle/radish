### Syntax

Not much here, or at least not something revolutionary, except unlike most languages, but like Scala and Python,
we're using `[]` instead of `<>`:

```
type Couple[A, B] {
    first: A
    second: B
}

type Maybe[T] = T | None
```

Mostly because `[` and `]` don't require pressing Shift, while `<` and `>` do.
And it looks marginally better this way... I think.
And we're using `<` and especially `>` a lot already (`->`).

We can make `array[index]` into `array.get(index)` and `[]` is completely, exclusively for generics.

Lastly, Java's `Optional<?>` is Radish's `Maybe[any]` (according to the definition above).

### To reify or not to reify...

By default, generics will be erased. But there is a way to have reification with `reified` keyword, per type parameter:

```
type PartiallyReified[A, reified B] {
    ; we can check what B is, but not what A is
}
```

Or:

```
reified type FullyReified[A, B] {
    ; shortcut, not to have to write "reified" as many times, as many type parameters there are
}
```

Reification will be done through code generation at compile time, so, if I understand correctly, like in C++ with its templates.

Reification is opt-in only because of performance and executable size concerns:

Use it only when you need it.

**Warning:** this section may be void, if it's impossible to achieve reification on LLVM:

### Variance

Basically Kotlin: `in`, `out` and `T of Supertype`, type projections. Declaration-site and use-site.

```
type Provider[out T] {
    provide: None -> T = () { ... }
}

type Consumer[in T] {
    consume: T -> None = (object) { ... }
}
```

Then, these are cool:

```
animalConsumer: Consumer[Animal] = ...
catConsumer: Consumer[Cat] = animalConsumer

catProvider: Provider[Cat] = ...
animalProvider: Provider[Animal] = catProvider
```

And these are not cool:

```
catConsumer: Consumer[Cat] = ...
animalConsumer: Consumer[Animal] = catConsumer

; we could then accept a dog and blow sh*t up if we used any Cat-specific properties in the object,
; which is still a cat consumer, after all

animalProvider: Provider[Animal] = ...
catProvider: Provider[Cat] = animalProvider

; here we actually have no guarantees that the animal returned from the provider is a cat
```

Nothing special... _cough_ I don't know why I tried to avoid it so much...

### Naming of type parameters

Various languages adopt different conventions. Mostly `T`, `U`, `V`.\
In general, I recommend `A`, `B`, `C` instead, but for just one type parameter, `T` is fine (because it's for "type").
But most importantly, I recommend:
- `E` for element (of collection, or something)
- `I` and `O` for input, output, for functions, like `map: [I, O] Iterable[I], I -> O = ...`
- `K`, `V` for key and value
- `R` for result
- `X`, `Y` for some 2D numeric coordinates, or something, for cartesian product, etc...
- and so on... basically the first letter of what the type parameter represents
