I had this brief glimpse of only allowing `panic` with a String, as in:

```
factorial = (x: Integer) -> Integer {
    if x < 0 {
        panic "negative factorial argument!"
    }
    if x == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    return x * self(x - 1)
}
```

But what about rescuing errors? Panicking with a String would actually be nice, if we never ever intended to `rescue`.
But if I do this, we can't rescue an error and return a union type, for example... In other words, if we disagree with
an APIs author that something is a problem, without `rescue` we can't use their code. We have to write our own.
And rescuing strings is just... meh...

Looks like I have to remove `rescue`. Panic is panic. Syntax is `panic "error message"` and that's it.
Want "checked exceptions"? Use union types. And I guess maybe some force-casting operator for when you know something
is impossible, and you are willing to take responsibility.

Except... what about server or GUI applications?
Should an error in one request handler of a REST API crash the entire server? Eh...
