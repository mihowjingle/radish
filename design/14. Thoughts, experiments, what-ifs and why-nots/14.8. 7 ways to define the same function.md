Is there such a thing as too much flexibility? We could easily disallow some of the following and still be able to do everything (from 4.2.):

```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) -> Number {
    return a + b
}
```
```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) {
    return a + b
}
```
```
sum: Number, Number -> Number = (a, b) {
    return a + b
}
```

And remember, `return` is optional.

```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) {
    a + b
}
```
```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) { a + b }
```
```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) -> Number { a + b }
```
```
sum: Number, Number -> Number = (a, b) { a + b }
```

So I was writing `clamp` (15. Samples), and I thought...

```
clamp: Number, Number, Number -> Number = (input, min, max) {
    return when {
        min > max       then panic "Lower bound is greater than the upper bound!"
        input > max     then max
        input < min     then min
        else input
    }
}
```

That looks nice, but how about this:

```
clamp: Number, Number, Number :: Number = input, min, max -> when {
    min > max       then panic "Lower bound is greater than the upper bound!"
    input > max     then max
    input < min     then min
    else input
}
```

Not sure if we can use `Type -> Type` for function type anymore, if not then `Type :: Type` would probably be good enough,
although an arrow conveys the idea of a function better.

Anyway, there's no way to write some - maybe not one-liner - but like above, _single-expression_ functions with the old style.\
Ok, there is, but it looks rather awkward:

```
clamp: Number, Number, Number -> Number = (input, min, max) { when {
        min > max       then panic "Lower bound is greater than the upper bound!"
        input > max     then max
        input < min     then min
        else input
    }
}
```

Well... I guess you'd just write this:

```
clamp: Number, Number, Number -> Number = (input, min, max) {
    when {
        min > max       then panic "Lower bound is greater than the upper bound!"
        input > max     then max
        input < min     then min
        else input
    }
}
```

At which point... why not just add a `return` for clarity? That's why I'm considering forbidding
some of the 7 (I think more, actually) ways to write functions...

Let's see `translate`, but with the new single-expression function syntax:

```
translate = infix [T] (condition: Boolean, ifTrue: T, ifFalse: T) -> if condition {
    ifTrue
} else {
    ifFalse
}
```

Some trivial "lambda", old syntax vs new syntax:

```
doubled = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map((x) { x * 2 })
doubled = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].map(x -> x * 2)
```

Yeah, old syntax is too good, it stays, at least for now. _However:_

```
sum = (a: Number, b: Number) -> Number {
    return a + b
}
```
```
sum: Number, Number -> Number = (a, b) {
    return a + b
}
```
```
sum: Number, Number -> Number = (a, b) { a + b }
```

These would probably be quite enough:
- _full form_
- _type-inferred full form_, or perhaps the _hybrid form_, because at the same time, it's like the one-liner, but not one line,\
  so let's say that when a one-liner is not one line anymore, it requires an explicit `return`
- _one-liner_, for simpler "lambdas" passed to other functions
- and lastly, the... _0-1 form_, or something? I don't know, but with 0 arguments, you can write the one-liner as `{ expression here }`,\
  same with 1 argument: `{ expression here }`, but your one argument is available under `arg`, like `it` in Kotlin:\
  `(x) { x + 1 }` becomes `{ arg + 1 }`

When I say "lambda" I mean it like in Java, or especially like Python's `lambda in : out`.\
I don't think we will be using that word (often) in Radish. They're just functions.\
I didn't unify syntax just to "diversify" the naming.

And for consistency, `yield` in blocks, so that there is never a lone, "dangling" expression at the end of some scope (taken from 4.1.):

```
r = 1
area = {
    pi = 3.14
    yield pi * r ** 2
} ; pi memory can be released now
```

And for an "early-return" in a block... Not sure about this one... we'll see...
