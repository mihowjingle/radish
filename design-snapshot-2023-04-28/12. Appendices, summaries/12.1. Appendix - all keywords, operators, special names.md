#### Keywords:

- `type` - definition of a custom type, kind of like a `class` and an `interface` at the same time
- `data type`, `value type` - specializations of `type`, see 2.3.
- `is` ...instance of a type
- `any` - for example `count = (list: List[any]) { list.length }`; for not caring about type parameters
- `of` - as in `type Subtype of Supertype { ... }`, inheritance
- `final` - to prevent the given type from being inherited from
- `from` - choosing implementation in case of diamond problem
- `if`
- `when` - "multi-if" and pattern matching
- `then` - a branch in `when`, and the "true" case in if-expression: `if a then b else c`
- `else` - to use after `if` and inside `when` as a "catch-all" default branch
- `return`
- `with` ...accumulator, for use in loops
- `but` - to help cope with the lack of mutability, like "this object, _but_ with some properties changed"
- `while`
- `break`
- `continue`
- `for`
- `in`
- `import`
- `as` - (manually) casting types, import aliases
- `error` - to define an error ("exception")
- `try`
- `panic` - `throw` in other languages
- `rescue` - `catch` in other languages
- `finally` - `finally` in other languages
- `infix` - syntactic sugar for multi-parameter functions to make them look like methods on the first parameter
- `unit` - for a kind of "singleton", a type with exactly one instance
- `self` - kind of like `this` for objects in other languages, but for functions, for recursion (all functions are anonymous)
- `slot` - "simple local object template", pretty much `class`, different from `type` in that these objects are mutable (and so have to have identity)
- `constructors` - inside of `slot`s, for (named) constructors
- `interface` - inside of `slot`s; everything in `interface` (and in `constructors`) is public, everything else is private
- `this` - for an object to refer to itself
- `mutation` - inside of `interface`s of `slot`s; for marking functions (methods) which mutate `this`
- `inline` - for inlining functions, an inline function's code gets copied into where it's invoked, the function "disappears" in compilation
- `export` - to make something importable in other files
- `reified` - opt-in reification of generics, per type parameter
- `in`, `out` - variance in generics
- `tail` - for ensuring a function is tail-recursive and optimized by the compiler (or getting an error if it's not possible)
- `mock` since we're leaning towards AOT compilation, native executables, no reflection etc., this may be needed for testing (?),\
  on the other hand, we have pure functions, ad-hoc type instantiation... so... I don't know...\
  so yeah - only if needed

#### Operators:
- `and or not xor` logical
- `+ - * /` standard arithmetic
- `**` power
- `//` floor/whole division
- `%` modulo
- `> >= <= < == =/=` comparisons
- `@=`, `@/=` identity
- `=` assignment
- `|` as in `Type | OtherType` union types
- `()` function invocation, prioritization of an operator as in `(a + b) * c` (obviously...)
- `[]` (maybe) access to an element of an array, array literal, if not `array.get(0)` and `arrayOf(some varargs here)`
  in which case `[]` would be free to use with generics
- `[T]` for type `T`, for generics
- `{}` not really an operator, but inside of strings, indicates interpolation
- `_` ignored unused parameters
- `++` string concatenation

#### Other:
- `root`, an `Array[String] -> None`, the main function
- `Error`, the "standard", "generic" error, for when there's nothing to say besides "whoops!"
- `arg`, the implicit argument of a single-argument function, Kotlin (and Groovy/Scala, I think): `it`
