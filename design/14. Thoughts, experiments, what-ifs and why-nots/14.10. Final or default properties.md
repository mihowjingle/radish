Consider a point (see 2.2.):

```
type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
    isAbove = (other: Point) { y > other.y }
}
```

Should then...

```
myPoint = Point {
    x = 0
    y = 5
    isAbove = (other) {
        return someOtherFunction(other)
    }
}
```

... be legal? In other words, is `isAbove` in the first code snippet final, or just default?

Or maybe, the question is already wrong? Neither final, nor default, because the first snippet should actually
produce a compilation error, because a type is just a type:

```
type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
    isAbove: Point -> Boolean
}
```

And then, if you say that `isAbove` shouldn't really be overrideable and part of the type (which I agree with,
because the definition of a point being above another point is quite simple and undisputable), but we still want to
make look good: `p1.isAbove(p2)`, not some `leftIsAboveRight(p1, p2)`, or something, then:

```
isAbove = infix (p1: Point, p2: Point) -> Boolean {
    return p1.y > p2.y
}
```

~~Of course, that makes the lack of overloading slightly more painful...~~

~~Unless, with `infix`, we somehow detect the first argument type and actually allow
multiple definitions with the same name as long as that type is always different?~~

~~Looks messy, but if I went this way then it would maybe look more like:~~

```
method isAbove = (p1: Point, p2: Point) -> Boolean {
    return p1.y > p2.y
}
```

~~So, `method` instead of `infix`, also yes, it's pretty much a method in its original, OOP sense -
a "special function which belongs to a type".~~

~~With this, we have a cool "side-effect" feature of being able to import only the methods you want...
if that's in any way better...~~

Nope...

The original meaning of `infix` stays:
1. if name collisions are a problem, you probably are defining too many things in one file
2. if 1. isn't the case, and you have a problem where you're importing those definitions with colliding names,
   use import aliases
