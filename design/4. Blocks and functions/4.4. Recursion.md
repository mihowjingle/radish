### Recursion

```
error NegativeFactorialInput ; or something

factorial = (x: Integer) {
    if x < 0 {
        panic NegativeFactorialInput
    }
    if x == 0 {
        return 1
    }
    self(x - 1) * x
}
```

Since all functions are anonymous, we can't access a function by its name before it's actually assigned to it.\
(Sometimes we don't assign functions at all, just use them in-place, what then?)\
We need `self` keyword, simple. Kind of like `this` for objects in so many languages.

By the way 1: you got a little preview tease of errors ("exceptions").\
By the way 2: this is not the best way (or at least only way) to write factorial.\
_cough-cough_ Tail recursion, passing the "current state" around.
