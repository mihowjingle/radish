### Data types

A specialization of `type`, a `data type` can not have functions (methods), or extend `type`s (because they (may) have functions).
In return, it automatically gets:
- deep equality (`Equatable`),
- covariance in generics,
- being valid map keys, and generally, wherever hashing applies (`Equatable`),
- toString (`Writeable`)
- and some facilitation of (almost) automatic serialization (a "constructor", `getProperties` with a tiny, tiny bit of "reflection" (not really),
  using code generation in compile time)

### Serialization

All `data type`s have `getProperties: None -> Map[String, Writeable | Map[String, any]]`
and a "constructor" `Map[String, Writeable | Map[String, any]] -> xxxx`.

Where:
- `xxxx` is the type in question
- this `any` is actually, again: `Writeable | Map[String, any]`, and so on, recursively. It's not guaranteed by the type system, but it's guaranteed.

```
data type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
}

map = mapOf(
    entry("x", 5),
    entry("y", 7)
)

point = Point(map)

write(point.x ++ ":" ++ point.y)
```

Will print `5:7`.

The "constructor" will panic with `ParsingError` when:
- any of the properties in the **map** is not in the **type** (including the type of the property, even if the names are the same)
- any of the properties in the **type** is not in the **map** (including the type of the property, even if the names are the same)

Now just write yourself a recursive...
- `toJson: Map[String, Writeable | Map[String, any]] -> String`, `fromJson: String -> Map[String, Writeable | Map[String, any]]`
- `toXml`, `fromXml`...
- anything you want...

This much "duct tape" shouldn't break anything really, but should allow for pretty much automatic de-/serialization,
after writing such a pair of functions **once**.

**Warning**: While this is a "design snapshot" and I tried to be as decisive as possible, I just don't know if this is
"good practice", or even possible. But, "something like that", yes.
