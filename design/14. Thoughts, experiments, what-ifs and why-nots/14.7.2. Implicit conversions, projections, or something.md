First, probably read 14.7. for context.

~~Now, how about some implicit conversions or projections, or both?~~ Nope, check bottom.

The idea is to provide polymorphism with (im)mutability and the problem with `type Animal = Dog & Cat` ("intersection types") in mind.

I'll probably have to allow the returning of `slot` objects from functions, and then:
- `slot`s are projectable as `slot`s
- `slot`s are projectable as `type`s
- `type`s are projectable as `slot`s
- `type`s are projectable as `type`s

All of the above, or just some? Plus nested `type`s and `slot`s?\
Plus the fact that sometimes the same object is returned, for performance, sometimes a new one is created,
depending on the implementation of a given projection?\
Anyway:

```
type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
}

type Animal {
    makeSound: None -> String
    position: Point
}

slot StatefulDog {
    position: Point
    
    constructors {
        new = ...
    }
    
    interface {
        bark = () {
            return "Woof!"
        }
        goTo = (point: Point) {
            position = point
        }
    }
    
    projection Animal { ; that Animal above, this is not a redeclaration, this EXPECTS an existing type
        makeSound = bark ; ... UGHHHH!!! bark could be mutating the dog...
        ; could the compiler detect it? or are we back to 'mutations' and 'properties', instead of 'interface'?
        ; and would THAT actually help?
        ; anyway, let's continue...
        position = position
    }
}

slot MutableCat {
    position: Point
    
    constructors {
        new = ...
    }
    
    interface {
        meow = () {
            return "Meow!"
        }
        goTo = (point: Point) {
            position = point
        }
    }
    
    projection Animal {
        makeSound = meow
        position = position
    }
    
    ; by the way, you COULD probably declare a new type at the same time:
    
    projection type SomethingElse { ; access it with MutableCat.SomethingElse
        ...
    }
}
```

And then...

```
function = (animal: Animal) { ... }

root = () {
    dog = StatefulDog.new()
    cat = MutableCat.new()
    function(dog) ; ok
    function(cat) ; ok
    ; the compiler would use its magic to find an applicable projection, or give a compilation error if there is none
}
```

Yeah... Speaking of magic, how exactly would the compiler know? Search everywhere? Follow `import`s?
Or is some equivalent of `extends`, or `implements` necessary?

Still... why not just...

```
root = () {
    function(Animal {
        makeSound = ...
        position = ...
    })
}
```

Or, by the way, even this? We know the type, after all...

```
root = () {
    function({
        makeSound = ...
        position = ...
    })
}
```

That last one may clash with `None -> some` functions (`()` being optional then),
or even 1-argument functions, when using `arg`. **TODO**

---------

Yeah... Bad.\
So maybe a compromise, like `data type`s (14.12.), which are automatically covariant?
Other, regular types would be invariant, that's it, no discussion?

So: a "flexibility vs simplicity" trade off?

... otherwise I think we embrace variance. (Probably.)
