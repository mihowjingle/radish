Damn!

Damn-damn!

Great Scott!

This was right under my nose for so long... Anyway, I forbid mutable objects from being captured in closures after predicting
problems with concurrency. But also, check 14. Samples - memoized. That's pretty harmless and useful...

What do we do? Looks like sometimes it would be good to forbid it, other times, we really shouldn't.

**Solution?**\
Not sure yet, but somehow detect when it is and isn't a problem? Like, forbid it by default, unless...
The **only** thing we're doing with such an object is capturing it in a closure?
Not sure how, not sure if it won't be too confusing, not sure if there are _still_ cases where it would be too restrictive...
_Not sure..._

**BIG TODO**, but see 13.30. Looks promising...
