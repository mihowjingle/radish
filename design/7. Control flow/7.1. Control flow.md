### If statement

```
condition: Boolean = 4 == 5

if condition {
    ; condition is satisfied
}

if x == 5 {
    ; x equals 5
}

if condition1 {
    ; condition1 is true
} else if condition2 {
    ; condition1 is not true, but condition2 is
} else {
    ; well... else
}
```

So unlike 99% languages, no parentheses around the condition. If is also an expression.

### If expression
```
y = if condition { 5 } else { 6 }
```

### Match-case or something

TBD what exactly, but I definitely want something.

Something like Kotlin's `when`, anyway - some "multi-if", also an expression, so maybe pattern matching as well?
Check Python's `match` for inspiration, maybe Scala's... whatever it has.\
Even Java is going this way recently.

The minimum is to just have a "better looking if-elseif-elseif-elseif-elseif-elseif-else".

### Loops: while

Boringly standard...

```
while condition {
    ; we're stuck until condition becomes false
}
```

Also:

```
while a {
    if b {
        break
    }
    if c {
        continue
    }
}
```

### Loops: for (each)

Again, you've seen this a million times:

```
for element in iterable {
    ; do stuff with element
}
```

(`break` and `continue` also applicable)

For example:

```
anyAboveFive = (numbers: Array<Number>) {
    for number in numbers {
        if number > 5.0 {
            return True
        }
    }
    return False
}
```

What if you want a "classic" `for (int x = 4; x < 11; x++)`?\
Short answer: Python.

Slightly longer answer:

```
for x in range(1, 9, step = 2) {
    ; do stuff with x
}
```

Something like that, give or take... TBD how it works under the hood, exactly.\
Both ends of the range are inclusive though (at least by default), c'mon Python, you **could** do better...
