### Documentation comments

`;` is a "normal" comment.\
`;;` directly above an identifier (function, constant, type...) will probably be a documentation comment.

With more of a free text approach, with argument names (and probably other identifiers too) in square brackets (like Kotlin),
and maybe some metadata, like `@returns`, `@deprecated`, or something...

Example:

```
value DivisionByZero

;; Safely divides the [dividend] by the [divisor].
;; Safely in that it returns [DivisionByZero] instead of panicking when the [divisor] is equal to zero.
;;
;; @deprecated use [evenSaferDivide] instead
;;
safeDivide = (dividend: Number, divisor: Number) -> Number | DivisionByZero {
    if divisor == 0 {
        return DivisionByZero
    }
    return dividend / divisor
}
```

~~Maybe~~ Probably we're going to ~~require~~ recommend an "empty" `;;` at the end, like above, ~~maybe not~~ (looks cleaner).
