### Type system

Now, that 14.14. is almost ready to be moved out of 14. (experimental) chapter, and we have 8.4. as well, let's sum it all up.

```
feature                                     <- cannot be instantiated, nor returned from a function,
                                               or even treated as a "type" in general,
                                               only expected as a "type projection" (as it is understood in Kotlin, I think)
                                               of an argument of a function,
                                               can be combined to make a sum (union) of the sets of attributes of the combined features


basically pre-Java 8 interface (no equivalent of default methods), freely ("ad-hoc") instantiable, the most basic kind, can "promise" features (1)
 |          types, but no functions, similar intended purpose to Java's records - deep equality and maybe some facilitation of serialization for free
 |           |              data types, but "flattened" and continuous, basically Project Valhalla, I think - should be more performant, in general
 |           |               |
 v           v               v
type        data type       value type      <- immutable!


slot                                        <- "simple local object template",
                                               a type, but mutable and can not be passed to a function,
                                               only local, or returned from a function (opposite of feature, in a way),
                                               can be upcast to a type (under certain conditions (see 8.4.))


value                                       <- a "singleton", or "unit", immutable, of course!
                                               ("unit" may end up being the keyword, actually)
```

_(1)_ Hmm, or is a `type` actually more like a `class`, with a "full" (argument for every field, 1:1) constructor
and all `public final` fields (if this was Java)?

And union (better: "disjunctive"? it's a "xor" not an "or") types (basically "sealed", I think) and also generic types (and functions):

```
type Maybe[T] = T | None

value North
value East
value South
value West

type Direction = North | East | South | West

anyMatch = [E] (list: List[E], predicate: E -> Boolean) -> Boolean { ... }

type Couple[A, B] {
    first: A
    second: B
}
```

And lastly, `Never`:
- you can never (pun intended) have an instance: `myConst: Never = ...` is illegal
- an uncallable function: `Never -> any type`
- a function which never (properly) returns: `any type(s) -> Never`

While the relationship between `slot`s and `type`s seems sound,
all the shenanigans with `feature`s were to avoid variance with generic types, but...
- I may just have fixed complexity with more complexity...
- ...if it's even correct

Also, union types seem a little bit like some kind of poor man's hybrid of sealed types and enums. Although they are simpler (only in syntax?)!\
Generally speaking, **TODO**

Check 14.19. for a slight variation...
