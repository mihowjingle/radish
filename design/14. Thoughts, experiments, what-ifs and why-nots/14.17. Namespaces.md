Another probably unneeded idea, but that's why it's in this chapter...

Namespaces. Or some other similar word, but what? Everyone would immediately know what a `namespace` is.

Standalone:

```
namespace MathConstants {
    pi = 3.14159265359
    e = 2.71828182846
}
```

And in a type if you like `static` in Java:

```
type Point {
    x: Number
    y: Number
    
    namespace {
        origin = Point { x = 0, y = 0 } ; and maybe a bunch of functions too... why not...
    }
    
    ...
}

whatIsIt = Point.origin
```

Then the `namespace` would automatically have the name of the `type`.

Question is... why? Why not just `origin` outside of `Point`, top level?

Namespaces would only help within the same file, at which point I think you're doing something wrong, if you need that.
Let me just copy-paste a fragment of 14.10:
1. if name collisions are a problem, you probably are defining too many things in one file
2. if 1. isn't the case, and you have a problem where you're importing those definitions with colliding names,
   use import aliases

... or import the entire file and _that's_ your "namespace", or import only what you need with an alias and _that's_ your "namespace".

Basically Python.
