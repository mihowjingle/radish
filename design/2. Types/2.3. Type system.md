### Type system

Now, that 13.14. is almost ready to be moved out of 13. (experimental) chapter, and we have 7.4. as well, let's sum it all up.

```
basically pre-Java 8 interfaces (no implementations), freely ("ad-hoc") instantiable, the most basic kind
 |          types, but disallow functions, cannot extend or contain types, but they get some cool features for free (1)
 |           |              data types, but "flattened" and continuous, basically Project Valhalla, I think - should be more performant, in general
 |           |               |
 v           v               v
type        data type       value type      <- immutable!


slot                                        <- "simple local object template",
                                               a type, but mutable and can not be passed to a function,
                                               only local, or returned from a function (opposite of feature, in a way),
                                               which is why it may end up being called "mutable type", not "slot"
                                               can be upcast to a type (under certain conditions (see 7.4.))


value                                       <- a "singleton", or "unit", immutable, of course!
                                               ("unit" may end up being the keyword, actually)
                                               (and probably cannot have functions, because why have a function attached to a singleton?
                                               just make a standalone function)
```

_(1)_ Such as:
- deep equality,
- covariance in generics (?),
- being valid map keys,
- and maybe some facilitation of (almost?) automatic serialization, using code generation in compile time

And union (better: "disjunctive"? it's a "xor" not an "or") types (basically "sealed", I think) and also generic types (and functions):

```
type Maybe[A] = A | None

value North
value East
value South
value West

type Direction = North | East | South | West

some = (this: Iterable[any E], predicate: E -> Boolean) -> Boolean {
    for element in this {
        if predicate(element) {
            return True
        }
    }
    return False
}

type Couple[A, B] {
    first: A
    second: B
}
```

And lastly, `Never`, the type with no instances/values:
- you can never (pun intended) have an instance: `myConst: Never = ...` is illegal
- an uncallable function: `Never -> any A`, illegal (right? otherwise what is its purpose? **TODO**)
- a function which never (properly) returns: `any A -> Never`

While the relationship between `slot`s and `type`s seems sound,
all the shenanigans with `feature`s were to avoid variance with generic types, but...
- I may just have fixed complexity with more complexity...
- ...if it's even correct

Also, union types seem a little bit like some kind of poor man's hybrid of sealed types and enums. Although they are simpler (only in syntax?)!\
Generally speaking, **TODO**

----

Check 13.19. for a slight variation...

**2023-04-27**:\
- `feature`s are mostly probably gone, something similar to 13.19. is probably going to be the case, but we will see
- `value` keyword is probably going to be `unit` instead, because `value` will probably be needed
for a local ~~"variable"~~ constant too often to have to come with something else not to clash with `value` the keyword
