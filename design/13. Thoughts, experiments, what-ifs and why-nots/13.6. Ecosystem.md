### Ecosystem

I probably want an entire ecosystem, not just the language and "let the community worry", or "community, fill in the gaps, please".
At least an official build system, strongly inspired by Gradle (which would mean we have to develop another,
simplified language and an interpreter for it, or use some subset of Radish),
or Maven (less flexible, but we can use an existing format, probably not xml though)...
