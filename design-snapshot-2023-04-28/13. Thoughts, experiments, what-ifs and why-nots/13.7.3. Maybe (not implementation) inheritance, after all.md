I wanted to see if I can get away with "shape"-, or "structure"-, in contrast to implementation- inheritance,
and then get (only) covariance for free (automatically):

```
type Consumer[A] {
    consume: A -> None
}

type Animal { ... }
type Cat of Animal { ... }
type Dog of Animal { ... }
```

A cat is a type of animal, so: `of`, pretty cool, IMHO.

Then, if types were always covariant:

```
root = () {
    consumer1: Consumer[Cat] = Consumer {
        consume = (cat: Cat) {
            ; ... use Cat-specific properties...
        }
    }
    consumer2: Consumer[Animal] = consumer1
    consumer2.consume(Dog { ... }) ; ... aaaaand BOOM, CRACK, HISS!,
    ; funny, if we only used Animal-specific, not Cat-specific properties in consume,
    ; this would be fine, we'd just have no guarantee it would be fine
}
```

**Nope**: any kind of inheritance -> (full) variance

**Unless**: types can not have functions, only other types, anyway - data (?)

**In which case, if it's even true**: we're back to looking for a way to make something `Iterable[_]`
