Keeping in mind, that I still need some operator for ignoring unused parameters of functions passed to other functions...\
maybe unused properties in destructuring - if I do destructuring, that is - and so on...

Let's consider ignoring the type parameter in generics, if for some reason I can't use the same thing.
Anyway, for any or all of those, I'm considering `some`, `_`, and `any`.

By the way, we need a name for a function to check if some iterable contains at least one element satisfying a predicate:

```
any = infix [T] (iterable: _ promises Iteration[T], predicate: T -> Boolean) -> Boolean {
    for element in iterable {
        if predicate(element) {
            return True
        }
    }
    return False
}
```

If we use `some` here, then `any` there, and vice versa. Or we could use `_` as the unused type parameter, which we probably will,
unless we can't. So probably `List[_]`, but maybe `List[some]`, or `List[any]`, now multiply that with `<>` instead of `[]`
for a total of six options...

And even if we can, well... look:

```
some = infix [T] (iterable: any promises Iteration[T], predicate: T -> Boolean) -> Boolean {
    for element in iterable {
        if predicate(element) {
            return True
        }
    }
    return False
}
```

Isn't `any promises Iteration[T]` beautiful? Literally "any type that we know we can iterate over, and get T's"...

This is not that important, we will see, just saving this for the future...

Maybe as a little afterthought, if I break my "reads out loud like just English" rule, with `_` and `::`:

```
some = infix [T] (iterable: _ :: Iteration[T], predicate: T -> Boolean) -> Boolean {
    for element in iterable {
        if predicate(element) {
            return True
        }
    }
    return False
}
```

Yeah, I don't think so... In any case, `[1, 3, 5, 7].some((x) { x > 6 })` or `[1, 3, 5, 7].any((x) { x > 6 })` will be `True`.

Oh, and one more thing: remember `arg` (Kotlin: `it`)? Like `[1, 3, 5, 7].some({ arg > 6 })`?\
How about `[1, 3, 5, 7].some({ _ > 6 })` (probably not)? Maybe with some other symbol, like `$` (still probably not)?
