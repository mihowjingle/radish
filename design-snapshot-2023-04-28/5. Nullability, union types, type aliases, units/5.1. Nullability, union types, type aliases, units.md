### Nullability, union types, type aliases

Nothing is nullable unless specified:

```
max = (a: Array[Integer]) -> Integer | None { ... }
```

By the way, equivalent:

```
type Maybe[T] = T | None
```

And then:

```
max = (a: Array[Integer]) -> Maybe[Integer] { ... }
```

Also, sometimes, when we don't really care what `T` actually is in, let's say `Maybe[T]`, only that it's a `Maybe`,
then we simply say `Maybe[any]`. So, `Optional<?>` in Java, pretty much.

#### Units: "singletons" and "enums"

A `unit` is its own type. Or a `unit` is a type with only one instance, named the same. Two ways of looking at it.

Kotlin/Scala: `object`.

In such a way, an "enum" would be just a union of a few "singletons":

```
unit Up
unit Down
unit Left
unit Right

type Direction = Up | Down | Left | Right
```

In Kotlin, it would look like this:
```
sealed class Direction {
    object Up : Direction()
    object Down : Direction()
    object Left : Direction()
    object Right : Direction()
}
```

Now, to achieve an "enum", if you need some property on all the units, just declare it on the union,
and you will be forced to provide an implementation in the union, or all the units:

```
type Vector {
    x: Integer
    y: Integer
}

type Movement {
    move: Integer -> Vector
}

unit Up
unit Down
unit Left
unit Right

type Direction of Movement = Up | Down | Left | Right ; compilation error(s): Up, Down, Left, Right do not implement Movement
```

Ok, try again:

```
unit Up of Movement {
    move = (distance) { Vector { x = 0, y = -distance } }
}

unit Down of Movement {
    move = (distance) { Vector { x = 0, y = distance } }
}

unit Left of Movement {
    move = (distance) { Vector { x = -distance, y = 0 } }
}

unit Right of Movement {
    move = (distance) { Vector { x = distance, y = 0 } }
}

type Direction of Movement = Up | Down | Left | Right
```

Or:

```
unit Up
unit Down
unit Left
unit Right

type Direction of Movement = Up | Down | Left | Right {
    move = (distance) {
        return when this {
            is Up then Vector { x = 0, y = -distance }
            is Down then Vector { x = 0, y = distance }
            is Left then Vector { x = -distance, y = 0 }
            is Right then Vector { x = distance, y = 0 }
        }
    }
}
```

A more real-life example of `unit`:

```
unit DivisionByZero

safeDivide = (dividend: Number, divisor: Number) -> Number | DivisionByZero {
    if divisor == 0 {
        return DivisionByZero
    }
    return dividend / divisor
}

result = safeDivide(3, 0)

if result is Number {
    ; result would be auto-cast to Number, but we never get here,
    ; because result is actually the DivisionByZero unit
}
```
