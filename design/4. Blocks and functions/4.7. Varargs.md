Hmmm... 50/50

**2023-04-16**:

Actually, probably yes. Too useful to give up, and sure, it will probably be just syntactic sugar for an ad-hoc array,
but, well...

**Wait...** What if any function that accepts an array, simply, automatically, accepts "varargs"?

```
doStuff = (array: Array<Integer>) -> None { ... }

doStuff([1, 2, 3])
doStuff([1, 2, 3, 4])

doStuff(1, 2, 3)
doStuff(1, 2, 3, 4)
```

Of course, for this to work, the array would have to be the last argument, etc.\
Why didn't Java 5 make it like this?\
Hmmmmmmm...

On the other hand, all this fuss to get rid of `[]` from time to time... Yeah, I'm back to 50/50...
