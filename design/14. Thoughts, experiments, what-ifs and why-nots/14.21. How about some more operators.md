Not really planning operator overloading (not saying no either), but how about some built-in ones?

Like to make making maps look slightly... cooler, I guess?\
Kotlin already has an infix `to` function... So... probably `=>`...

Another example is probably `..` for ranges.

This is completely redundant... Probably a **nope**, just saving for future reference...
