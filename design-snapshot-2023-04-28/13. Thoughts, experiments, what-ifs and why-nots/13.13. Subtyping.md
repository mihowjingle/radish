How about...

```
type Month of Integer min 1 max 12
```

... or something, anyway, you get the point.

```
type Cowboy of String oneof "Good", "Bad", "Ugly"
```

... and so on?

Weird, but kind of cool. Like union types for values, except... we already have that:

```
value January
value February
...
value December

type Month = January | February | ... | December
```

Ok, granted, more typing (no pun intended).

Which brings me to another point; originally, I wasn't planning to give `value`s properties, but...

```
value January {
    number = 1
}
; ... and so on
```

Otherwise, you'd have to make a function:

```
numberOf = (month: Month) {
    if month is January {
        return 1
    } else ...
}
```

Yup, arduous and boring. And inefficient at runtime, because we have to go through all the `if`s every time we want to get
the number of a month, especially for `December`, it's going to be 11 misses, before it finds it... _(1)_ _(2)_

**And!** We can't guarantee that every `Month` has a `number` property, it just happens to be the case, but the compiler doesn't know it.

So it seems to possible, but somewhat cumbersome. Other costs? Many, many more keywords, like `min`, `max`, `oneof` (or something), and so on.
And it's only for the "primitives".

**TODO** variance?

_(1)_ Ok, you'd actually make a `Map<Month, Number>`, but with a function, the compiler could enforce exhaustiveness,
with a map it's your responsibility (?)

_(2)_ We could also make the function `memoized`, check 14. Samples/memoized.rd

Anyway, nevermind all this _(3)_, **BIG NOPE**, check 13.14.

_(3)_ Except for allowing values (at least primitive literals) in union types,
_that may_ make some sense, probably still no, though. **TODO**
