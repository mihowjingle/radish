So how about `this` keyword also being an option for the name of (only) the **first** argument of a function?
And then we can get rid of the `infix` keyword...

```
anyMatch = (this: Iterable[some E], predicate: E -> Boolean) -> Boolean {
    for element in this {
        if predicate(element) {
            return True
        }
    }
    return False
}
```

instead of

```
anyMatch = infix (elements: Iterable[some E], predicate: E -> Boolean) -> Boolean {
    for element in elements {
        if predicate(element) {
            return True
        }
    }
    return False
}
```

The only problem I can see is the overloading of `this`. It's already the keyword for an object to refer to itself,
and also probably will denote the "private" insides of a `slot`. But I wouldn't worry about it... for now.
