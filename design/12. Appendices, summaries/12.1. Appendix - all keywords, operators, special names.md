#### Keywords:

- `type` - definition of a custom type, not an object though, so not `class`, more like `interface`, if anything
- `data type`, `value type` - specializations of `type`, see 2.3. and 13.19., maybe `mutable type` instead of `slot` as well (check below)
- `is` ...instance of a type
- `any` - for example `count = (list: List<any>) { list.length }`; for not caring about `type`s and type parameters in a function
- `of` - as in `type Subtype of Supertype { ... }`, inheritance
- `if`
- `when` - "multi-if" and pattern matching
- `then` - a branch in `when`
- `else` - to use after `if` and inside `when` as a "catch-all" default branch
- `return`
- `with` ...accumulator, for use in loops
- `but` - to help cope with the lack of mutability, like "this object, _but_ with some properties changed"
- `while`
- `break`
- `continue`
- `for`
- `in`
- `from` - when we want to import only some stuff, but not the entire file... basically Python
- `import`
- `as` - (manually) casting types, import aliases (is the "overloading" a problem?)
- `error` - to define an error ("exception")
- `try`
- `panic` - `throw` in other languages
- `rescue` - `catch` in other languages
- `finally` - `finally` in other languages
- `infix` - syntactic sugar for multi-parameter functions to make them look like methods on the first parameter
- `value` - or probably `unit`, for a kind of "singleton", a type with exactly one instance
- `self` - kind of like `this` for objects, but for functions, for recursion (all functions are anonymous)
- `slot` - "simple local object template", pretty much `class`, different from `type` in that these objects are mutable (and so have to have identity)
- `constructors` - inside of `slot`s, for (named) constructors
- `interface` - inside of `slot`s; everything in `interface` (and in `constructors`) is public, everything else is private
- `this` - for an object to refer to itself
- `mutation` - inside of `interface`s of `slot`s; for marking functions (methods) which mutate `this`

#### Maybe keywords:

- `alias` if for some reason I can't "overload" `type` for stuff like `type Maybe some T = T | None`
- `elif` if `else if` is... somehow... not an option? I don't know, 99% no on this
- `inline` for, well, inlining functions and maybe some other stuff, an inline function's code gets copied into where it's invoked,\
  the function "disappears" in compilation
- `internal`, or maybe `private` to prevent stuff from being imported in other files, unless I pull a 180 on this\
  and everything is private unless `export`ed, but 99% not
- `otherwise` - I'm 99% sure it will be a function in the stdlib, but anyway, `?:` in Kotlin
- `some`, (or `any`), for **defining** generic types and functions,\
  like let's say `map = (array: Array<some T>, function: T -> some R) -> Array<R> { ... }`\
  instead of `map = <T, R> (array: Array<T>, function: T -> R) -> Array<R> { ... }`
- `recur`, or something, if I decide that it sounds better than `self`, for recursion (unlikely)
- `cast` for (manually) casting types if `as` can't be both for casting and importing with alias
- `mock` since we're leaning towards AOT compilation, native runnables, no reflection etc., this may be needed for testing (?),
  on the other hand, we have pure functions, ad-hoc type instantiation... so... I don't know...
- `match` instead of `when`, maybe...
- `namespace`s, maybe...
- `reified` - opt-in reification of generics, per type parameter
- `in`, `out` - variance in generics
- `tail` - for ensuring a function is tail-recursive and optimized by the compiler (or getting an error if it's not possible)


#### Operators:
- `and or not xor` logical
- `+ - * /` standard arithmetic
- `**` power
- `//` floor/whole division
- `%` modulo
- `> >= <= < == =/=` comparisons
- `@=` identity ~~(not sure if it's needed since mutable objects are strictly local, but we'll see)~~, `@/=`? Ugh...
- `=` assignment
- `|` as in `Type | OtherType` union types
- `()` function invocation, prioritization of an operator as in `(a + b) * c` (obviously...)
- `[]` (maybe) access to an element of an array, array literal, if not `array.get(0)` and `array(some varargs here)`
  in which case `[]` would be free to use with generics
- `<T>`, or `[T]` for type `T`, for generics
  (or, in the case of `some`, at least **using** previously defined generic types and functions)
- `{}` not really an operator, but inside of strings, indicates interpolation
- `_` ignored unused parameters (and type parameters if this isn't `some` or `any`)
- `++` string concatenation?
- operator overloading?

#### Other:
- `root`, an `Array<String> -> None`, the main function
- `Error`, the "standard", "generic" error, for when there's nothing to say besides "whoops!"
- `arg`, the implicit argument of a single-argument function, Kotlin (and Groovy/Scala, I think): `it`
