### Concurrency

We'll probably try to not tear a muscle, but _some_ concurrency, yes.\
No sharing state between threads, etc.

#### The basic async/await

```
sum = (array: Array[Integer]) {
    with acc = 0 for x in array {
        acc += x
    }
    return acc
}
```
```
twoAdditionalThreadsSum = (array: Array[Integer]) {
    middle = array.size / 2
    left = array.slice(0, middle)
    right = array.slice(middle + 1, a.size - 1)
    deferredLeftSum = async({
        sum(left)
    })
    deferredRightSum = async({
        sum(right)
    })
    sums = awaitAll(deferredLeftSum, deferredRightSum)
    return sums.get(0) + sums.get(1)
}
```

I guess we could just await each sum "blockingly", independently, right? Even if `rightSum` is available first,
we still have to wait for `leftSum` anyway. Like:

```
twoAdditionalThreadsSum = (array: Array[Integer]) {
    middle = array.size / 2
    left = array.slice(0, middle)
    right = array.slice(middle + 1, array.size - 1)
    deferredLeftSum = async({
        sum(left)
    })
    deferredRightSum = async({
        sum(right)
    })
    leftSum = await(deferredLeftSum)
    rightSum = await(deferredRightSum)
    return leftSum + rightSum
}
```

Another way:

```
twoAdditionalThreadsSum = (array: Array[Integer]) {
    middle = array.size / 2
    left = array.slice(0, middle)
    right = array.slice(middle + 1, array.size - 1)
    tasks = arrayOf(left, right).map((subArray) {
        return async(() {
            sum(subArray)
        })
    })
    return sum(awaitAll(tasks))
}
```

Something like that...\
Meanwhile, somewhere in the stdlib:

```
async = [T] (task: None -> T) -> Deferred[T] {
    ... some low-level shenanigans, anyway start the task in a new thread and return immediately
}

await = [T] (future: Deferred[T]) -> T {
    ... some low-level shenanigans, anyway block until the result is available, then return it
}

awaitAll = [T] (future: Array[Deferred[T]]) -> Array[T] {
    ... some low-level shenanigans, anyway block until last task returns, then return all results at once
}
```

By the way... `future: Deferred[T]`? Well, then maybe `Future[T]`, not `Deferred[T]`...\
Ah, we'll see. You get the gist. Yeah, I know, this is supposed to be a "design snapshot". Decision!\
But it's really minor... One of those, anyway.

#### The "not really a new thread"

Basically, check Kotlin and steal coroutines.

For situations when you won't see an improvement by creating a new thread, because there is no "work" (computation) to do, just some waiting.\
Like for a response from some remote service... Database, HTTP client, whatever... So you can just reuse the current thread.

Investigate suspending functions (Kotlin) and virtual threads (Java Project Loom)...

#### Thread pools

All the async/await again, but instead of being standalone functions and starting new single threads, and then killing the threads,
make the functions methods of some `type ThreadPool`, or something... Manage the number of threads and everything.
Kill the threads when the pool goes out of scope, etc...

#### Timeouts, interruptions, ...

Well... Yes...
