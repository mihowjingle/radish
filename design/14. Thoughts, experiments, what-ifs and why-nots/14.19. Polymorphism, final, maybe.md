Since the best I could get in 14.18. was - pretty much what I wanted but also - having to duplicate `type`s and identical `feature`s
(probably quite often), then 14.14. stays.

But:

**Option A:**

As described in 14.14.: `feature`s are allowed only in function signatures, on the "in" side, as a (kind of) type, or a type projection.
So, only one of...
- `function = (type: Feature) -> Type { ... }`, which is short for...
- `function = (type: _ promises Feature) -> Type { ... }`, or
- `function = (genericType: Type[Feature]) -> Type { ... }`, which is short for...
- `function = (genericType: Type[_ promises Feature]) -> Type { ... }`, or
- `function = (genericType: Feature[Type]) -> Type { ... }`, which is short for...
- `function = (genericType: _ promises Feature[Type]) -> Type { ... }` (but this is just the first/second option), or
- `function = [T promises Feature] (type: T) -> Type { ... }`, or
- `function = [T promises Feature] (type: Type[T]) -> Type { ... }`

... and maybe `::`, or something, instead of `promises`...

**Option B:**

As described in 14.14.: `feature`s are allowed anywhere, but only as `_ promises Feature`, not directly.
Still not sure if that fixes contravariance though. And even if it does, then the `_ promises Something` will be
a frequent "pattern" of boilerplate.

**Option C:**

`type`s can not have functions, so actually `data type`s are just `type`s now. That would mean there is no way
that a `type` "consumes" something. Automatically covariant, boom! Then we can ditch `feature`s and let `type`s simply "extend"
each other. ~~Probably more like `type TypeC combines TypeA, TypeB` or just `type TypeC :: TypeA, TypeB`.
Because it's not exactly inheritance, even if "topologically" it is.~~ ~~Wait, `type Dog combines Animal`? Combines with what?
Maybe `includes`, I don't know why not just `extends`, but well... Just some ideas...~~\
Never-mind, I forgot I already have that settled: `type Subtype of Supertype`.

For now, it's **A**, until something proves it to be a bad idea.

----

And if option **C** wins, let's copy (the main part of) 2.3. here, with changes applied:

```
basically pre-Java 8 interfaces (no implementations), freely ("ad-hoc") instantiable, the most basic kind, if they happen to be generic, they're invariant!
 |          types, but disallow functions, cannot extend or contain types (at least those that have functions, we'll see), but they get some cool features for free (1)
 |           |              data types, but "flattened" and continuous, basically Project Valhalla, I think - should be more performant, in general
 |           |               |
 v           v               v
type        data type       value type      <- immutable!


slot                                        <- "simple local object template",
                                               a type, but mutable and can not be passed to a function,
                                               only local, or returned from a function,
                                               which is why it may end up being called "mutable type", not "slot"
                                               can be upcast to a type (under certain conditions (see 8.4.))


value                                       <- a "singleton", or "unit", immutable, of course!
                                               ("unit" may end up being the keyword, actually)
                                               (and probably cannot have functions, because why have a function attached to a singleton?
                                               just make a standalone function)
```

_(1)_ Such as:
- deep equality,
- covariance,
- being valid map keys,
- and maybe some facilitation of (almost?) automatic serialization

Main difference:
- no `feature`s...
- `type`s extend each other...

... with restrictions:
- a `data type` can extend only other `data type`s
- a `type` can extend `data type`s, `type`s
- a `value type` can extend `value type`s and maybe `data type`s, if it's not too confusing (should technically be possible, I think)
- a `slot` can extend `data type`s, `type`s, and we need `property` keyword to make `person.isAdult()` into `person.isAdult`, or...
- a `slot` can extend only `type`s
