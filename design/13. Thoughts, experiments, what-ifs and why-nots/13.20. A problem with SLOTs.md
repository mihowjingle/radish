Eh... I thought I had it...

The problem:

```
type Type {
    function: SomeType -> SomeOtherType
}

slot Something :: Type {
    ; ... some private mutable state
    
    constructors {
        new = () { ... }
    }
    
    interface {
        someMutation = mutation (someType: SomeType) { ... }
        function = (someType: SomeType) -> SomeOtherType { ... } ; overrides Type.function
    }
}

root = (_) {
    something = Something.new()
    x: Type = something
    something.someMutation(...)
    ; oh no! x just mutated!
}
```

Even if we forbid upcasting "outside", and only allow upcasting a `slot` to a `type` inside the `slot` itself, like `return this as Type`,
the same problem is still possible.

Possible solution(s):
1. use scopes and `with`, somehow (how?), or
2. compiler should detect (how, exactly?) and forbid the above situation: assigning an instance of a `slot` to multiple constants\
when at least one of them is as the `slot` itself (when all the constants refer to the object as a `type`,\
then it's fine, we can't mutate the object)\
**wait...** maybe we just disallow multiple assignment of `slot` objects to constants in general? does that hinder us in any way?
3. we only allow upcasting inside `slot` itself and when a `slot` implements a `type` or `function type`,
it can **only** return itself as that type, not as itself...\
complicated as hell, but... well...

Ok, I think got it, we're going with the "aggressive" option 2: no assigning `slot` objects to mutliple constants at all (in the same scope).\
By the way, this is a nice "excuse" to have blocks (4.1.).

Anyway, **TODO** confirm...
